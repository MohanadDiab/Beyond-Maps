The plan is to create a map centered around Milan, Italy, where these sensors are located, and then overlay the PM2.5 concentration values as a heatmap. If `folium` does not directly support heatmaps with explicit values per location, we&#x27;ll use a workaround by simulating the concentration effect through repeated coordinates based on their values.\n\nFirst, ensure you have `folium` installed in your environment. If not, you can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install folium\n```\n\nHere&#x27;s the Python script that does what you&#x27;re looking for:\n\n```python\nimport folium\nfrom folium.plugins import HeatMap\n\n# Define the coordinates and PM2.5 concentration values\ndata = {\n    &quot;Via Santa Marta, Milan, Italy&quot;: {&quot;coords&quot;: [45.462231, 9.183522], &quot;pm2.5&quot;: 14.18},\n    &quot;Sensor Oggiaro, Milan, Italy&quot;: {&quot;coords&quot;: [45.485895, 9.190435], &quot;pm2.5&quot;: 14.77},\n    &quot;Sensor Corso 22 Marzo, Milan, Italy&quot;: {&quot;coords&quot;: [45.462082, 9.210209], &quot;pm2.5&quot;: 10.05},\n    &quot;Sensor Piazzale Libia, Milan, Italy&quot;: {&quot;coords&quot;: [45.454005, 9.209494], &quot;pm2.5&quot;: 4.27}\n}\n\n# Initialize the map centered around Milan\nm = folium.Map(location=[45.464664, 9.188540], zoom_start=12)\n\n# Prepare the heatmap data, considering PM2.5 values\nheatmap_data = []\nfor info in data.values():\n    # Each location is repeated in proportion to its PM2.5 value to simulate concentration\n    repeats = int(info[&quot;pm2.5&quot;])  # This is a simple approach; adjust the scaling as needed\n    heatmap_data.extend([info[&quot;coords&quot;]] * repeats)\n\n# Add the heatmap layer\nHeatMap(heatmap_data).add_to(m)\n\n# Save the map to an HTML file\nm.save(&#x27;milan_pm2_5_heatmap.html&#x27;)\n\nprint(&quot;Heatmap generated and saved as milan_pm2_5_heatmap.html&quot;)\n```\n\nThis script initializes a `folium` map centered around Milan and then creates a heatmap layer based on the specified PM2.5 concentration values and coordinates. The PM2.5 values are used to determine the &quot;weight&quot; of each point on the heatmap, with a simple approach of repeating coordinates based on the PM2.5 value to simulate concentration. Finally, the map is saved as an HTML file, which you can open with any web browser to view the heatmap visualization.\n\nAdjust the `repeats` calculation in the script if you need a more refined control over how much each PM2.5 value influences the heatmap. The direct influence of specific values on the heatmap appearance may require a more complex approach depending on your exact visualization needs and the capabilities of the `folium` library."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2f345-1c3a-4919-97ca-86b9760f22e1", "request_id": "8618eda80ea68ab0-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2f345-1c3a-4919-97ca-86b9760f22e1", "children": ["aaa238a4-7360-4d4e-9769-cae470e793c8"]}, "aaa238a4-7360-4d4e-9769-cae470e793c8": {"id": "aaa238a4-7360-4d4e-9769-cae470e793c8", "message": {"id": "aaa238a4-7360-4d4e-9769-cae470e793c8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709965078.770528, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["are there any python libraries thar can produce a static plot over the map?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8618f1ecdf2a8ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "8efbc2d0-3c3d-4ffd-b502-888e72d482a7", "children": ["c6feb3f1-5436-4e67-8857-c308945afdbb"]}, "c6feb3f1-5436-4e67-8857-c308945afdbb": {"id": "c6feb3f1-5436-4e67-8857-c308945afdbb", "message": {"id": "c6feb3f1-5436-4e67-8857-c308945afdbb", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709965117.252975, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, for creating static plots over maps in Python, there are several libraries you can use. Among the most popular are `matplotlib` combined with `basemap` or `cartopy`, and `geopandas` for geospatial data processing and plotting. Each of these libraries has its strengths and use cases. Here&#x27;s a brief overview:\n\n### 1. Matplotlib with Basemap or Cartopy\n\n- **Basemap**: It&#x27;s a matplotlib toolkit for plotting 2D data on maps. Basemap is no longer actively developed, so for new projects, Cartopy is recommended.\n- **Cartopy**: It&#x27;s a library providing cartographic tools for Python. Cartopy makes it easy to draw maps for data analysis and visualization.\n\n#### Example with Cartopy:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nax.coastlines()\n\n# Plotting points\nlocations = {\n    &quot;Piazzale Libia&quot;: [45.454005, 9.209494],\n    &quot;Corso 22 Marzo&quot;: [45.462082, 9.210209],\n    &quot;Oggiaro&quot;: [45.485895, 9.190435],\n    &quot;Via Santa Marta&quot;: [45.462231, 9.183522]\n}\n\nfor loc, (lat, lon) in locations.items():\n    ax.plot(lon, lat, marker=&#x27;o&#x27;, color=&#x27;red&#x27;, markersize=5, transform=ccrs.Geodetic())\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### 2. Geopandas\n\n`Geopandas` extends the datatypes used by `pandas` to allow spatial operations on geometric types. It is great for working with and plotting geospatial data.\n\n#### Example with Geopandas:\n```python\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom shapely.geometry import Point\n\n# Create a GeoDataFrame with the points\ndata = {\n    &quot;Location&quot;: [&quot;Piazzale Libia&quot;, &quot;Corso 22 Marzo&quot;, &quot;Oggiaro&quot;, &quot;Via Santa Marta&quot;],\n    &quot;Coordinates&quot;: [(45.454005, 9.209494), (45.462082, 9.210209), (45.485895, 9.190435), (45.462231, 9.183522)]\n}\n\ngdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data, geometry=[Point(xy) for xy in data[&#x27;Coordinates&#x27;]])\n\n# Set the coordinate reference system (CRS) to WGS84\ngdf.crs = &quot;EPSG:4326&quot;\n\n# Plot\nworld = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path(&#x27;naturalearth_lowres&#x27;))\nax = world[world.continent == &#x27;Europe&#x27;].plot(color=&#x27;white&#x27;, edgecolor=&#x27;black&#x27;)\ngdf.plot(ax=ax, color=&#x27;red&#x27;)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThese libraries allow for the creation of static maps with overlaid data points, which can be customized extensively for different visualizations, including heatmaps, point markers, lines, and polygons. For a heatmap specifically, `matplotlib` provides some tools, but integrating it with geospatial data for a static map would require more manual work compared to dynamic libraries like `folium`. However, these examples should give you a good starting point for creating static map visualizations with Python."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata":

In the context of geospatial data, many providers publicly provide data either on their interface or they provide an API to that end. Examples of services that provide geospatial data in an open-sourced manner with the option to fetch them using an API are services like Google Earth Engine (GEE) [59], Copernicus Hub [60], and many other sources.\n\nIn our first experiment, we prompted the language model to write a script that will use Google\u2019s earth engine to retrieve some data available on the platform. However, it is important to note that the model itself cannot make API calls within its online environment due to some backend restrictions, and the fact that it does not have an API key to the service the user is interested in.\n\nBut the model can generate code and provide the script needed to achieve the task. For the task at hand the response of the model returned a piece of code containing some bugs, the response is provided in figure 4.8. In GEE, they don\u2019t directly use an API key in the \u201cee\u201d library, they instead provide a link where the user needs to authenticate their session, then they receive a session token that they can use in the notebook to initialize the earth engine\u2019s object. In the model\u2019s response, the earth engine object is called directly without trying to call the authentication method first, this renders the code useless.\n\n \n\nFigure \u200e4.6: Script sample from GPT-4\u2019s response for the GEE data retrieval task.\n\n\nHowever, in the notes of the prompt, the model encourages the user to authenticate the earth engine before running the script, this task can be easily done by a person with a programming background, but for an inexperienced user, this may prove to be a hazy concept.\n\nA follow up prompt was given to the model to encourage it to provide the authentication process and display the full running code without any bugs. The response included new functions that encapsulate the existing functionalities and an added function that handles the authentication process.\n\nIn the second prompt, even though the script is written correctly and should run without any issues, another issue arises, being that GEE implemented a new API stack that requires the user to specify a project in the initialization method, this project must be created manually by the user in the GEE interface. However, since GPT-4\u2019s training process makes it oblivious to the world after its training phase ended in April 2023 [61], the model was unaware of this change, rendering the script it provided outdated.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "861817dfae5c8ac2-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "11cb9f38-9da2-4bc7-bb13-afd5c6a37ddc", "children": ["a1574eaa-ed3b-4f67-b1df-bbc125113a36"]}, "a1574eaa-ed3b-4f67-b1df-bbc125113a36": {"id": "a1574eaa-ed3b-4f67-b1df-bbc125113a36", "message": {"id": "a1574eaa-ed3b-4f67-b1df-bbc125113a36", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709956148.019133, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Understood."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa29288-b88b-41fd-8e06-165da618e204", "request_id": "861817dfae5c8ac2-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa29288-b88b-41fd-8e06-165da618e204", "children": ["aaa2eeb8-4f94-4c16-bcf2-5909f39b3419"]}, "aaa2eeb8-4f94-4c16-bcf2-5909f39b3419": {"id": "aaa2eeb8-4f94-4c16-bcf2-5909f39b3419", "message": {"id": "aaa2eeb8-4f94-4c16-bcf2-5909f39b3419", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709956166.619252, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-kG3EoaZZyGVZ3HrCo3W89Hva", "size_bytes": 149400, "width": 752, "height": 519, "fovea": null, "metadata": null}, ""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"name": "Picture1.png", "id": "file-kG3EoaZZyGVZ3HrCo3W89Hva", "size": 149400, "mimeType": "image/png", "width": 752, "height": 519}], "request_id": "86181857cb6a8ac2-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "a1574eaa-ed3b-4f67-b1df-bbc125113a36", "children": ["4bc34503-fb85-4a51-8172-89115fa1c0fe"]}, "4bc34503-fb85-4a51-8172-89115fa1c0fe": {"id": "4bc34503-fb85-4a51-8172-89115fa1c0fe", "message": {"id": "4bc34503-fb85-4a51-8172-89115fa1c0fe", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709956211.596028, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Applications often extract data from databases or external sources through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Many providers offer geospatial data publicly, either via a user interface or an API, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) [59] and Copernicus Hub [60].\n\nWe conducted an experiment where GPT-4 was instructed to write a script for using GEE to fetch data. Due to backend limitations and the absence of an API key, GPT-4 cannot make actual API calls but can produce the necessary script. The generated script in Figure 4.8 had some errors. Notably, GEE does not use API keys directly; it requires users to authenticate through a link to obtain a session token for subsequent requests. The provided script incorrectly attempted to use the Earth Engine API without this authentication, resulting in non-functional code.\n\nNonetheless, the language model suggested in the notes that users should authenticate with the Earth Engine before running the script. While straightforward for those with programming knowledge, this advice might be less clear to novices.\n\nA second request was made for the language model to include the authentication process in the code. The revised script had added functions, including one for authentication. However, due to updates in GEE requiring users to specify a project in the initialization, and since GPT-4&#x27;s training ended in April 2023, it was not aware of these changes, and the script remained outdated [61].\n\nReferring to the figure provided, it depicts a Python script intended to interact with GEE.

In your case, it would be the number of parks that are not identified as such.\n   \n2. **Commission Error (False Positive Rate)**: This is when negative cases are incorrectly identified as positive. In your scenario, it would be the locations identified as parks when they are not.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Ground truth (actual number of parks): 94\n- Response (number of identified parks): 54\n- Locations identified: 6 (implying you verified 6 out of the 54 responses)\n- Incorrectly identified locations: 3\n\nAssumptions based on your statement for calculation:\n- You checked 6 out of the 54, and found that 3 were incorrect. This suggests you had a 50% commission error rate in the sample checked.\n- Because you didn&#x27;t specify how many of the 94 parks were actually identified correctly, we will assume the response of 54 includes the 6 checked (with 3 being wrong). Therefore, the omission error needs to reflect parks not identified.\n\nTo calculate the errors:\n- **Omission Error** = (Number of actual parks - Number of correctly identified parks) / Number of actual parks. We need to find the number of correctly identified parks.\n- **Commission Error** = Number of wrongly identified parks / Total responses evaluated for correctness.\n\nLet&#x27;s calculate these errors based on the provided information. For commission error, we directly know 3 out of 6 checked were incorrect, but for omission, we need to infer the number of correctly identified parks. Given the ambiguity in the exact number of correct identifications (since out of 54, we don&#x27;t know how many are true positives except in the 6 checked), we&#x27;ll calculate the commission error as directly stated and discuss how omission error calculation might vary based on possible interpretations."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100265]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2a614-1eb7-40c8-b9a1-da32bd9fd6d3", "request_id": "8617b4b469b28ac5-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2a614-1eb7-40c8-b9a1-da32bd9fd6d3", "children": ["36b4a107-e3aa-46c0-ba96-2446abf4f5f4"]}, "36b4a107-e3aa-46c0-ba96-2446abf4f5f4": {"id": "36b4a107-e3aa-46c0-ba96-2446abf4f5f4", "message": {"id": "36b4a107-e3aa-46c0-ba96-2446abf4f5f4", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709952119.069772, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "# Given data\r\ntotal_parks_ground_truth = 94\r\nresponse_identified_parks = 54 # Not directly used in calculations given the ambiguity\r\nlocations_checked = 6\r\nincorrect_locations = 3\r\n\r\n# Commission error calculation (Based on locations checked since it&#x27;s a sample)\r\ncommission_error_sample = incorrect_locations / locations_checked\r\n\r\n# For omission error, we need to infer or calculate based on assumptions, which isn&#x27;t directly possible with given data.\r\n# However, assuming all identified were correct (best case scenario) -

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects) to simplify its representation or to make it more meaningful and easier to analyze. In this context, the term &quot;Segment Anything&quot; suggests a model that is highly versatile and capable of segmenting various objects or features within an image, regardless of their specific type or category.\n\nThis kind of model would typically be based on deep learning, particularly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or variants such as U-Net, which are well-suited for image analysis tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. The &quot;Segment Anything&quot; model would be trained on a large and diverse dataset of images annotated with precise object boundaries, allowing it to learn a wide range of object forms, sizes, and appearances. This enables the model to accurately segment objects in new, unseen images, making it useful for applications in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, satellite image analysis, and more, where understanding the precise location and shape of various objects within an image is crucial."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2dc1e-dfb2-452b-a277-838caca1d7a6", "request_id": "86116137ec2f8aae-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2dc1e-dfb2-452b-a277-838caca1d7a6", "children": ["aaa20367-bbea-4444-8509-45cf41c343f3"]}, "aaa20367-bbea-4444-8509-45cf41c343f3": {"id": "aaa20367-bbea-4444-8509-45cf41c343f3", "message": {"id": "aaa20367-bbea-4444-8509-45cf41c343f3", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709885778.996421, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what about gpt-4v"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "861161e558b38aae-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "c46dd50c-88ac-473f-9b4b-38aa732e2d16", "children": ["f751922c-de9d-4bf2-9c0b-c7f6f213c0dc"]}, "f751922c-de9d-4bf2-9c0b-c7f6f213c0dc": {"id": "f751922c-de9d-4bf2-9c0b-c7f6f213c0dc", "message": {"id": "f751922c-de9d-4bf2-9c0b-c7f6f213c0dc", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709885802.342307, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["As of my last update in April 2023, there was no specific model officially named &quot;GPT-4v&quot; released or detailed by OpenAI.

These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we\u2019ve undertaken as a company. I\u2019m genuinely excited for what\u2019s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere.\n\n\u2013 Sundar\n\n## Introducing Gemini \n\nBy Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team \n\nAI has been the focus of my life&#x27;s work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I\u2019ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways.\n\nThis promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we\u2019ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive \u2014 an expert helper or assistant.\n\nToday, we\u2019re a step closer to this vision as \u301059\u2020we introduce Gemini\u2020deepmind.google\u3011, the most capable and general model we\u2019ve ever built.\n\nGemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.\n\n[Image 1: Introducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model.] \n\n10:25\n\nIntroducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model\n\nGemini is also our most flexible model yet \u2014 able to efficiently run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Its state-of-the-art capabilities will significantly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI.\n\nWe\u2019ve optimized Gemini 1.0, our first version, for three different sizes:\n\n  * Gemini Ultra \u2014 our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.\n  * Gemini Pro \u2014 our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.\n  * Gemini Nano \u2014 our most efficient model for on-device tasks.\n\n## State-of-the-art performance \n\nWe&#x27;ve been rigorously testing our Gemini models and evaluating their performance on a wide variety of tasks. From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra\u2019s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\n\nWith a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on \u301060\u2020MMLU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\n\nOur new benchmark approach to MMLU enables Gemini to use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, leading to significant improvements over just using its first impression.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks including text and coding.\n\nGemini Ultra also achieves a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new \u301061\u2020MMMU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 benchmark, which consists of multimodal tasks spanning different domains requiring deliberate reasoning.\n\nWith the image benchmarks we tested, Gemini Ultra outperformed previous state-of-the-art models, without assistance from optical character recognition (OCR) systems that extract text from images for further processing. These benchmarks highlight Gemini\u2019s native multimodality and indicate early signs of Gemini&#x27;s more complex reasoning abilities.\n\nSee more details in our \u301062\u2020Gemini technical report\u2020goo.gle\u3011.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal benchmarks.\n\n## Next-generation capabilities \n\nUntil now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved training separate components for different modalities and then stitching them together to roughly mimic some of this functionality. These models can sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like describing images, but struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning.\n\nWe designed Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on different modalities.

Its ability to handle video data as sequential images, interweaved with text or audio inputs, exemplifies its multimodal prowess.\n\n[Image 4: Gemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs]\n\nGemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs \n\nAccessing Gemini \n\nGemini 1.0 is rolling out across Google&#x27;s ecosystem, including Bard, which now benefits from the refined capabilities of Gemini Pro. Google has also integrated Gemini into its Search, Ads, and Duet services, enhancing user experience with faster, more accurate responses.\n\nFor those keen on harnessing the capabilities of Gemini, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex offer access to Gemini Pro, with the latter providing greater customization and security features.\n\nTo experience the enhanced capabilities of Bard powered by Gemini Pro, users can take the following straightforward steps:\n\n  1. Navigate to Bard: Open your preferred web browser and go to the Bard website.\n  2. Secure Login: Access the service by signing in with your Google account, assuring a seamless and secure experience.\n  3. Interactive Chat: You can now use Bard, where Gemini Pro&#x27;s advanced features can be opted.\n\nPower of Multimodality:\n\nAt its core, Gemini utilizes a transformer-based architecture, similar to those employed in successful NLP models like GPT-3. However, Gemini&#x27;s uniqueness lies in its ability to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and code. This is achieved through a novel technique called cross-modal attention, which allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between different types of data.\n\nHere&#x27;s a breakdown of Gemini&#x27;s key components:\n\n  * Multimodal Encoder:\u00a0This module processes the input data from each modality (e.g.,\u00a0text,\u00a0image) independently,\u00a0extracting relevant features and generating individual representations.\n  * Cross-modal Attention Network:\u00a0This network is the heart of Gemini.\u00a0It allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between the different representations,\u00a0enabling them to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and enrich their understanding.\n  * Multimodal Decoder:\u00a0This module utilizes the enriched representations generated by the cross-modal attention network to perform various tasks,\u00a0such as image captioning,\u00a0text-to-image generation,\u00a0and code generation.\n\nGemini model isn&#x27;t just about understanding text or images\u2014it&#x27;s about integrating different kinds of information in a way that&#x27;s much closer to how we, as humans, perceive the world.

Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we\u2019ve undertaken as a company. I\u2019m genuinely excited for what\u2019s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere.\n\n\u2013 Sundar\n\n## Introducing Gemini \n\nBy Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team \n\nAI has been the focus of my life&#x27;s work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I\u2019ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways.\n\nThis promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we\u2019ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive \u2014 an expert helper or assistant.\n\nToday, we\u2019re a step closer to this vision as \u301059\u2020we introduce Gemini\u2020deepmind.google\u3011, the most capable and general model we\u2019ve ever built.\n\nGemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.\n\n[Image 1: Introducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model.] \n\n10:25\n\nIntroducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model\n\nGemini is also our most flexible model yet \u2014 able to efficiently run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Its state-of-the-art capabilities will significantly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI.\n\nWe\u2019ve optimized Gemini 1.0, our first version, for three different sizes:\n\n  * Gemini Ultra \u2014 our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.\n  * Gemini Pro \u2014 our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.\n  * Gemini Nano \u2014 our most efficient model for on-device tasks.\n\n## State-of-the-art performance \n\nWe&#x27;ve been rigorously testing our Gemini models and evaluating their performance on a wide variety of tasks. From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra\u2019s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\n\nWith a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on \u301060\u2020MMLU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\n\nOur new benchmark approach to MMLU enables Gemini to use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, leading to significant improvements over just using its first impression.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks including text and coding.\n\nGemini Ultra also achieves a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new \u301061\u2020MMMU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 benchmark, which consists of multimodal tasks spanning different domains requiring deliberate reasoning.\n\nWith the image benchmarks we tested, Gemini Ultra outperformed previous state-of-the-art models, without assistance from optical character recognition (OCR) systems that extract text from images for further processing. These benchmarks highlight Gemini\u2019s native multimodality and indicate early signs of Gemini&#x27;s more complex reasoning abilities.\n\nSee more details in our \u301062\u2020Gemini technical report\u2020goo.gle\u3011.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal benchmarks.\n\n## Next-generation capabilities \n\nUntil now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved training separate components for different modalities and then stitching them together to roughly mimic some of this functionality. These models can sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like describing images, but struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning.\n\nWe designed Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on different modalities. Then we fine-tuned it with additional multimodal data to further refine its effectiveness.

This new large language model is integrated across Google&#x27;s vast array of products, offering improvements that ripple through services and tools used by millions.\n\nGemini, Google&#x27;s advanced multimodal AI, is birthed from the collaborative efforts of the unified DeepMind and Brain AI labs. Gemini stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, promising to deliver a more interconnected and intelligent suite of applications.\n\nThe announcement of Google Gemini, nestled closely after the debut of Bard, Duet AI, and the PaLM 2 LLM, marks a clear intention from Google to not only compete but lead in the AI revolution.\n\nContrary to any notions of an AI winter, the launch of Gemini suggests a thriving AI spring, teeming with potential and growth. As we reflect on a year since the emergence of ChatGPT, which itself was a groundbreaking moment for AI, Google&#x27;s move indicates that the industry&#x27;s expansion is far from over; in fact, it may just be picking up pace.\n\n## What is Gemini?\n\nGoogle&#x27;s Gemini model is capable of processing diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. It comes in three versions\u2014Ultra, Pro, and Nano\u2014each tailored for specific applications, from complex reasoning to on-device use. Ultra excels in multifaceted tasks and will be available on Bard Advanced, while Pro offers a balance of performance and resource efficiency, already integrated into Bard for text prompts. Nano, optimized for on-device deployment, comes in two sizes and features hardware optimizations like 4-bit quantization for offline use in devices like the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nGemini&#x27;s architecture is unique in its native multimodal output capability, using discrete image tokens for image generation and integrating audio features from the Universal Speech Model for nuanced audio understanding. Its ability to handle video data as sequential images, interweaved with text or audio inputs, exemplifies its multimodal prowess.\n\n[Image 4: Gemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs]\n\nGemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs \n\nAccessing Gemini \n\nGemini 1.0 is rolling out across Google&#x27;s ecosystem, including Bard, which now benefits from the refined capabilities of Gemini Pro. Google has also integrated Gemini into its Search, Ads, and Duet services, enhancing user experience with faster, more accurate responses.\n\nFor those keen on harnessing the capabilities of Gemini, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex offer access to Gemini Pro, with the latter providing greater customization and security features.\n\nTo experience the enhanced capabilities of Bard powered by Gemini Pro, users can take the following straightforward steps:\n\n  1.

Interactive Chat: You can now use Bard, where Gemini Pro&#x27;s advanced features can be opted.\n\nPower of Multimodality:\n\nAt its core, Gemini utilizes a transformer-based architecture, similar to those employed in successful NLP models like GPT-3. However, Gemini&#x27;s uniqueness lies in its ability to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and code. This is achieved through a novel technique called cross-modal attention, which allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between different types of data.\n\nHere&#x27;s a breakdown of Gemini&#x27;s key components:\n\n  * Multimodal Encoder:\u00a0This module processes the input data from each modality (e.g.,\u00a0text,\u00a0image) independently,\u00a0extracting relevant features and generating individual representations.\n  * Cross-modal Attention Network:\u00a0This network is the heart of Gemini.\u00a0It allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between the different representations,\u00a0enabling them to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and enrich their understanding.\n  * Multimodal Decoder:\u00a0This module utilizes the enriched representations generated by the cross-modal attention network to perform various tasks,\u00a0such as image captioning,\u00a0text-to-image generation,\u00a0and code generation.\n\nGemini model isn&#x27;t just about understanding text or images\u2014it&#x27;s about integrating different kinds of information in a way that&#x27;s much closer to how we, as humans, perceive the world. For instance, Gemini can look at a sequence of images and determine the logical or spatial order of objects within them. It can also analyze the design features of objects to make judgments, such as which of two cars has a more aerodynamic shape.\n\nBut Gemini&#x27;s talents go beyond just visual understanding. It can turn a set of instructions into code, creating practical tools like a countdown timer that not only functions as directed but also includes creative elements, such as motivational emojis, to enhance user interaction. This indicates an ability to handle tasks that require a blend of creativity and functionality\u2014skills that are often considered distinctly human.\n\n[Image 5: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning (\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\n[Image 6: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks(\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\nGemini sophisticated design is based on a rich history of neural network research and leverages Google\u2019s cutting-edge TPU technology for training.

This new large language model is integrated across Google&#x27;s vast array of products, offering improvements that ripple through services and tools used by millions.\n\nGemini, Google&#x27;s advanced multimodal AI, is birthed from the collaborative efforts of the unified DeepMind and Brain AI labs. Gemini stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, promising to deliver a more interconnected and intelligent suite of applications.\n\nThe announcement of Google Gemini, nestled closely after the debut of Bard, Duet AI, and the PaLM 2 LLM, marks a clear intention from Google to not only compete but lead in the AI revolution.\n\nContrary to any notions of an AI winter, the launch of Gemini suggests a thriving AI spring, teeming with potential and growth. As we reflect on a year since the emergence of ChatGPT, which itself was a groundbreaking moment for AI, Google&#x27;s move indicates that the industry&#x27;s expansion is far from over; in fact, it may just be picking up pace.\n\n## What is Gemini?\n\nGoogle&#x27;s Gemini model is capable of processing diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. It comes in three versions\u2014Ultra, Pro, and Nano\u2014each tailored for specific applications, from complex reasoning to on-device use. Ultra excels in multifaceted tasks and will be available on Bard Advanced, while Pro offers a balance of performance and resource efficiency, already integrated into Bard for text prompts. Nano, optimized for on-device deployment, comes in two sizes and features hardware optimizations like 4-bit quantization for offline use in devices like the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nGemini&#x27;s architecture is unique in its native multimodal output capability, using discrete image tokens for image generation and integrating audio features from the Universal Speech Model for nuanced audio understanding. Its ability to handle video data as sequential images, interweaved with text or audio inputs, exemplifies its multimodal prowess.\n\n[Image 4: Gemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs]\n\nGemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs \n\nAccessing Gemini \n\nGemini 1.0 is rolling out across Google&#x27;s ecosystem, including Bard, which now benefits from the refined capabilities of Gemini Pro. Google has also integrated Gemini into its Search, Ads, and Duet services, enhancing user experience with faster, more accurate responses.\n\nFor those keen on harnessing the capabilities of Gemini, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex offer access to Gemini Pro, with the latter providing greater customization and security features.\n\nTo experience the enhanced capabilities of Bard powered by Gemini Pro, users can take the following straightforward steps:\n\n  1. Navigate to Bard: Open your preferred web browser and go to the Bard website.\n  2. Secure Login: Access the service by signing in with your Google account, assuring a seamless and secure experience.\n  3. Interactive Chat: You can now use Bard, where Gemini Pro&#x27;s advanced features can be opted.\n\nPower of Multimodality:\n\nAt its core, Gemini utilizes a transformer-based architecture, similar to those employed in successful NLP models like GPT-3. However, Gemini&#x27;s uniqueness lies in its ability to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and code. This is achieved through a novel technique called cross-modal attention, which allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between different types of data.\n\nHere&#x27;s a breakdown of Gemini&#x27;s key components:\n\n  * Multimodal Encoder:\u00a0This module processes the input data from each modality (e.g.,\u00a0text,\u00a0image) independently,\u00a0extracting relevant features and generating individual representations.\n  * Cross-modal Attention Network:\u00a0This network is the heart of Gemini.\u00a0It allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between the different representations,\u00a0enabling them to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and enrich their understanding.\n  * Multimodal Decoder:\u00a0This module utilizes the enriched representations generated by the cross-modal attention network to perform various tasks,\u00a0such as image captioning,\u00a0text-to-image generation,\u00a0and code generation.\n\nGemini model isn&#x27;t just about understanding text or images\u2014it&#x27;s about integrating different kinds of information in a way that&#x27;s much closer to how we, as humans, perceive the world. For instance, Gemini can look at a sequence of images and determine the logical or spatial order of objects within them. It can also analyze the design features of objects to make judgments, such as which of two cars has a more aerodynamic shape.\n\nBut Gemini&#x27;s talents go beyond just visual understanding. It can turn a set of instructions into code, creating practical tools like a countdown timer that not only functions as directed but also includes creative elements, such as motivational emojis, to enhance user interaction. This indicates an ability to handle tasks that require a blend of creativity and functionality\u2014skills that are often considered distinctly human.\n\n[Image 5: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning (\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\n[Image 6: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks(\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\nGemini sophisticated design is based on a rich history of neural network research and leverages Google\u2019s cutting-edge TPU technology for training.

Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we\u2019ve undertaken as a company. I\u2019m genuinely excited for what\u2019s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere.\n\n\u2013 Sundar\n\n## Introducing Gemini \n\nBy Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team \n\nAI has been the focus of my life&#x27;s work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I\u2019ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways.\n\nThis promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we\u2019ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive \u2014 an expert helper or assistant.\n\nToday, we\u2019re a step closer to this vision as \u301059\u2020we introduce Gemini\u2020deepmind.google\u3011, the most capable and general model we\u2019ve ever built.\n\nGemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video.\n\n[Image 1: Introducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model.] \n\n10:25\n\nIntroducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model\n\nGemini is also our most flexible model yet \u2014 able to efficiently run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Its state-of-the-art capabilities will significantly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI.\n\nWe\u2019ve optimized Gemini 1.0, our first version, for three different sizes:\n\n  * Gemini Ultra \u2014 our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.\n  * Gemini Pro \u2014 our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.\n  * Gemini Nano \u2014 our most efficient model for on-device tasks.\n\n## State-of-the-art performance \n\nWe&#x27;ve been rigorously testing our Gemini models and evaluating their performance on a wide variety of tasks. From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra\u2019s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\n\nWith a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on \u301060\u2020MMLU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\n\nOur new benchmark approach to MMLU enables Gemini to use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, leading to significant improvements over just using its first impression.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks including text and coding.\n\nGemini Ultra also achieves a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new \u301061\u2020MMMU\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 benchmark, which consists of multimodal tasks spanning different domains requiring deliberate reasoning.\n\nWith the image benchmarks we tested, Gemini Ultra outperformed previous state-of-the-art models, without assistance from optical character recognition (OCR) systems that extract text from images for further processing. These benchmarks highlight Gemini\u2019s native multimodality and indicate early signs of Gemini&#x27;s more complex reasoning abilities.\n\nSee more details in our \u301062\u2020Gemini technical report\u2020goo.gle\u3011.\n\nGemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal benchmarks.\n\n## Next-generation capabilities \n\nUntil now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved training separate components for different modalities and then stitching them together to roughly mimic some of this functionality. These models can sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like describing images, but struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning.\n\nWe designed Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on different modalities. Then we fine-tuned it with additional multimodal data to further refine its effectiveness. This helps Gemini seamlessly understand and reason about all kinds of inputs from the ground up, far better than existing multimodal models \u2014 and its capabilities are state of the art in nearly every domain.\n\nLearn more about \u301059\u2020Gemini\u2019s capabilities and see how it works\u2020deepmind.google\u3011.\n\n### Sophisticated reasoning \n\nGemini 1.0\u2019s sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written and visual information. This makes it uniquely skilled at uncovering knowledge that can be difficult to discern amid vast amounts of data.\n\nIts remarkable ability to extract insights from hundreds of thousands of documents through reading, filtering and understanding information will help deliver new breakthroughs at digital speeds in many fields from science to finance.\n\n[Image 2: Gemini unlocks new scientific insights.] \n\n10:25\n\nGemini unlocks new scientific insights\n\n### Understanding text, images, audio and more \n\nGemini 1.0 was trained to recognize and understand text, images, audio and more at the same time, so it better understands nuanced information and can answer questions relating to complicated topics.

It is a single model that can easily perform both interactive segmentation and automatic segmentation. The model\u2019s promptable interface (described shortly) allows it to be used in flexible ways that make a wide range of segmentation tasks possible simply by engineering the right prompt for the model (clicks, boxes, text, and so on). Moreover, SAM is trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset of over 1 billion masks (collected as part of this project), which enables it to generalize to new types of objects and images beyond what it observed during training. This ability to generalize means that, by and large, practitioners will no longer need to collect their own segmentation data and fine-tune a model for their use case. \n\nTaken together, these capabilities enable SAM to generalize both to new tasks and to new domains. This flexibility is the first of its kind for image segmentation. \n\nHere is a short video showcasing some of SAM\u2019s capabilities: \n\n[Image 8]\n\nSomething Went Wrong\n\nWe&#x27;re having trouble playing this video.\n\n\u30106\u2020Learn more\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n(1) SAM allows users to segment objects with just a click or by interactively clicking points to include and exclude from the object. The model can also be prompted with a bounding box. \n\n(2) SAM can output multiple valid masks when faced with ambiguity about the object being segmented, an important and necessary capability for solving segmentation in the real world. \n\n(3) SAM can automatically find and mask all objects in an image. \n\n(4) SAM can generate a segmentation mask for any prompt in real time after precomputing the image embedding, allowing for real-time interaction with the model. \n\n## How SAM works: Promptable segmentation\n\nIn natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision, one of the most exciting developments is that of foundation models that can perform zero-shot and few-shot learning for new datasets and tasks using \u201cprompting\u201d techniques. We took inspiration from this line of work. \n\nWe trained SAM to return a valid segmentation mask for any prompt, where a prompt can be foreground/background points, a rough box or mask, freeform text, or, in general, any information indicating what to segment in an image. The requirement of a valid mask simply means that even when a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects (for example, a point on a shirt may indicate either the shirt or the person wearing it), the output should be a reasonable mask for one of those objects. This task is used to pretrain the model and to solve general downstream segmentation tasks via prompting. \n\nWe observed that the pretraining task and interactive data collection imposed specific constraints on the model design. In particular, the model needs to run in real time on a CPU in a web browser to allow our annotators to use SAM interactively in real time to annotate efficiently. While the runtime constraint implies a trade-off between quality and runtime, we find that a simple design yields good results in practice. \n\nUnder the hood, an image encoder produces a one-time embedding for the image, while a lightweight encoder converts any prompt into an embedding vector in real time. These two information sources are then combined in a lightweight decoder that predicts segmentation masks. After the image embedding is computed, SAM can produce a segment in just 50 milliseconds given any prompt in a web browser. \n\n[Image 9]\n\nIn a web browser, SAM efficiently maps the image features and a set of prompt embeddings to produce a segmentation mask. \n\n## Segmenting 1 billion masks: How we built SA-1B\n\nTo train our model, we needed a massive and diverse source of data, which did not exist at the start of our work. The segmentation dataset we are releasing today is the largest to date (by far). The data was collected using SAM. In particular, annotators used SAM to interactively annotate images, and then the newly annotated data was used to update SAM in turn. We repeated this cycle many times to iteratively improve both the model and dataset. \n\nWith SAM, collecting new segmentation masks is faster than ever before. With our tool, it only takes about 14 seconds to interactively annotate a mask. Our per-mask annotation process is only 2x slower than annotating bounding boxes, which takes about 7 seconds using the fastest annotation interfaces. In comparison with previous large-scale segmentation data collection efforts, our model is 6.5x faster than COCO fully manual polygon-based mask annotation and 2x faster than the previous largest data annotation effort, which was also model-assisted. \n\nHowever, relying on interactively annotating masks does not scale sufficiently to create our 1 billion mask dataset. Therefore, we built a data engine for creating our SA-1B dataset. This data engine has three \u201cgears.\u201d In the first gear, the model assists annotators, as described above. The second gear is a mix of fully automatic annotation combined with assisted annotation, helping increase the diversity of collected masks. The last gear of the data engine is fully automatic mask creation, allowing our dataset to scale. \n\nOur final dataset includes more than 1.1 billion segmentation masks collected on about 11 million licensed and privacy-preserving images. SA-1B has 400x more masks than any existing segmentation dataset, and as verified by human evaluation studies, the masks are of high quality and diversity, and in some cases even comparable in quality to masks from the previous much smaller, fully manually annotated datasets. \n\n[Image 10][Image 11]\n\nSegment Anything\u2019s capabilities are the result of training on millions of images and masks collected using a data engine.

Thus, ensuring precision in treatment and minimizing side effects.\n  * Land Cover Mapping: SAM can be utilized to classify and map different types of land cover, enabling applications in urban planning, \u301036\u2020agriculture\u3011, and environmental monitoring.\n\n[Image 28: YOLOv8 applied in smart cities for pothole detection.][Image 29: YOLOv8 applied in smart cities for pothole detection.]Segmentation applied in \u301037\u2020smart cities\u3011 with a bounding box for pothole detection.\n\n### The Future Potential \n\nSAM\u2019s potential extends beyond current applications. In fields like environmental monitoring, it could aid in analyzing satellite imagery for climate change studies or disaster response.\n\nIn \u301038\u2020retail\u3011, SAM could revolutionize inventory management through automated product recognition and categorization.\n\nSAM\u2019s unequaled adaptability and accuracy positions it to be the new standard in image segmentation. Its ability to learn from a vast and diverse dataset means it can continuously improve and adapt to new challenges.\n\nWe can expect SAM to evolve with better real-time processing capabilities. With this evolution, we can expect to see SAM become ubiquitous in fields like autonomous vehicles and real-time \u301039\u2020surveillance\u3011.

It operates in real-time, producing segmentation masks in just 50 milliseconds after computing the image embedding\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nSAM&#x27;s remarkable capabilities stem from its training on the Segment Anything 1-Billion (SA-1B) Dataset, the largest and most diverse image segmentation dataset to date, containing over 1 billion masks from approximately 11 million images. This dataset covers a broad spectrum of scenarios, objects, and environments, and was created using a novel data engine process involving assisted manual annotation, semi-automatic refinement, and full-auto mask generation by SAM itself\u301016\u2020source\u3011\u301017\u2020source\u3011.\n\nApplications of SAM span various domains, from AI-assisted labeling, which significantly streamlines the process of labeling images, to healthcare, where SAM&#x27;s precision in identifying specific regions can aid in targeted drug delivery.

It is a single model that can easily perform both interactive segmentation and automatic segmentation. The model\u2019s promptable interface (described shortly) allows it to be used in flexible ways that make a wide range of segmentation tasks possible simply by engineering the right prompt for the model (clicks, boxes, text, and so on). Moreover, SAM is trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset of over 1 billion masks (collected as part of this project), which enables it to generalize to new types of objects and images beyond what it observed during training. This ability to generalize means that, by and large, practitioners will no longer need to collect their own segmentation data and fine-tune a model for their use case. \n\nTaken together, these capabilities enable SAM to generalize both to new tasks and to new domains. This flexibility is the first of its kind for image segmentation. \n\nHere is a short video showcasing some of SAM\u2019s capabilities: \n\n[Image 8]\n\nSomething Went Wrong\n\nWe&#x27;re having trouble playing this video.\n\n\u30106\u2020Learn more\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n(1) SAM allows users to segment objects with just a click or by interactively clicking points to include and exclude from the object. The model can also be prompted with a bounding box. \n\n(2) SAM can output multiple valid masks when faced with ambiguity about the object being segmented, an important and necessary capability for solving segmentation in the real world. \n\n(3) SAM can automatically find and mask all objects in an image. \n\n(4) SAM can generate a segmentation mask for any prompt in real time after precomputing the image embedding, allowing for real-time interaction with the model. \n\n## How SAM works: Promptable segmentation\n\nIn natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision, one of the most exciting developments is that of foundation models that can perform zero-shot and few-shot learning for new datasets and tasks using \u201cprompting\u201d techniques. We took inspiration from this line of work. \n\nWe trained SAM to return a valid segmentation mask for any prompt, where a prompt can be foreground/background points, a rough box or mask, freeform text, or, in general, any information indicating what to segment in an image. The requirement of a valid mask simply means that even when a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects (for example, a point on a shirt may indicate either the shirt or the person wearing it), the output should be a reasonable mask for one of those objects. This task is used to pretrain the model and to solve general downstream segmentation tasks via prompting. \n\nWe observed that the pretraining task and interactive data collection imposed specific constraints on the model design. In particular, the model needs to run in real time on a CPU in a web browser to allow our annotators to use SAM interactively in real time to annotate efficiently. While the runtime constraint implies a trade-off between quality and runtime, we find that a simple design yields good results in practice. \n\nUnder the hood, an image encoder produces a one-time embedding for the image, while a lightweight encoder converts any prompt into an embedding vector in real time. These two information sources are then combined in a lightweight decoder that predicts segmentation masks. After the image embedding is computed, SAM can produce a segment in just 50 milliseconds given any prompt in a web browser. \n\n[Image 9]\n\nIn a web browser, SAM efficiently maps the image features and a set of prompt embeddings to produce a segmentation mask. \n\n## Segmenting 1 billion masks: How we built SA-1B\n\nTo train our model, we needed a massive and diverse source of data, which did not exist at the start of our work. The segmentation dataset we are releasing today is the largest to date (by far). The data was collected using SAM. In particular, annotators used SAM to interactively annotate images, and then the newly annotated data was used to update SAM in turn. We repeated this cycle many times to iteratively improve both the model and dataset. \n\nWith SAM, collecting new segmentation masks is faster than ever before. With our tool, it only takes about 14 seconds to interactively annotate a mask. Our per-mask annotation process is only 2x slower than annotating bounding boxes, which takes about 7 seconds using the fastest annotation interfaces. In comparison with previous large-scale segmentation data collection efforts, our model is 6.5x faster than COCO fully manual polygon-based mask annotation and 2x faster than the previous largest data annotation effort, which was also model-assisted. \n\nHowever, relying on interactively annotating masks does not scale sufficiently to create our 1 billion mask dataset. Therefore, we built a data engine for creating our SA-1B dataset. This data engine has three \u201cgears.\u201d In the first gear, the model assists annotators, as described above.

We took inspiration from this line of work. \n\nWe trained SAM to return a valid segmentation mask for any prompt, where a prompt can be foreground/background points, a rough box or mask, freeform text, or, in general, any information indicating what to segment in an image. The requirement of a valid mask simply means that even when a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects (for example, a point on a shirt may indicate either the shirt or the person wearing it), the output should be a reasonable mask for one of those objects. This task is used to pretrain the model and to solve general downstream segmentation tasks via prompting. \n\nWe observed that the pretraining task and interactive data collection imposed specific constraints on the model design. In particular, the model needs to run in real time on a CPU in a web browser to allow our annotators to use SAM interactively in real time to annotate efficiently. While the runtime constraint implies a trade-off between quality and runtime, we find that a simple design yields good results in practice. \n\nUnder the hood, an image encoder produces a one-time embedding for the image, while a lightweight encoder converts any prompt into an embedding vector in real time. These two information sources are then combined in a lightweight decoder that predicts segmentation masks. After the image embedding is computed, SAM can produce a segment in just 50 milliseconds given any prompt in a web browser. \n\n[Image 9]\n\nIn a web browser, SAM efficiently maps the image features and a set of prompt embeddings to produce a segmentation mask. \n\n## Segmenting 1 billion masks: How we built SA-1B\n\nTo train our model, we needed a massive and diverse source of data, which did not exist at the start of our work. The segmentation dataset we are releasing today is the largest to date (by far). The data was collected using SAM. In particular, annotators used SAM to interactively annotate images, and then the newly annotated data was used to update SAM in turn. We repeated this cycle many times to iteratively improve both the model and dataset. \n\nWith SAM, collecting new segmentation masks is faster than ever before. With our tool, it only takes about 14 seconds to interactively annotate a mask. Our per-mask annotation process is only 2x slower than annotating bounding boxes, which takes about 7 seconds using the fastest annotation interfaces. In comparison with previous large-scale segmentation data collection efforts, our model is 6.5x faster than COCO fully manual polygon-based mask annotation and 2x faster than the previous largest data annotation effort, which was also model-assisted. \n\nHowever, relying on interactively annotating masks does not scale sufficiently to create our 1 billion mask dataset. Therefore, we built a data engine for creating our SA-1B dataset. This data engine has three \u201cgears.\u201d In the first gear, the model assists annotators, as described above. The second gear is a mix of fully automatic annotation combined with assisted annotation, helping increase the diversity of collected masks. The last gear of the data engine is fully automatic mask creation, allowing our dataset to scale. \n\nOur final dataset includes more than 1.1 billion segmentation masks collected on about 11 million licensed and privacy-preserving images.

Compared to OpenImages V5, there are 6x more images and 400x more masks in the dataset.\n\n## What Can SAM Do?\n\nThe possibilities while using SAM are endless. With its zero-shot generalization capability, SAM can segment objects in images without additional training.\n\nThe following are some of the major contributions that SAM can possibly make.\n\n### Augmented Reality\n\nIdentifying everyday objects is one of the biggest achievements of SAM. Coupled with AR and AR glasses, it can help users with reminders and instructions.\n\n[Image 13: Segment Anything model used in Augmented Reality.][Image 14: Segment Anything model used in Augmented Reality.]\n\nNot only that, in AR/VR users can segment and lift objects in the virtual world just by the user\u2019s gaze.\u00a0\n\n### Bio-Medical Image Segmentation\n\nMedical image segmentation and cell microscopy are some of the hardest to tackle. But SAM can assist in the segmentation of cell-microscopy images out of the box without any retraining.\n\n[Image 15: Cell microscopy image segmentation using the Segment Anything model.][Image 16: Cell microscopy image segmentation using the Segment Anything model.]\n\n### Integration with Diffusion Models\n\nWe can also integrate SAM with diffusion based image generation models. This will automate a lot of things, especially creating masks while inpainting.\u00a0\n\n### Generating Semantic Segmentation Datasets\n\nBecause SAM can segment out objects so well, we can use it to generate masks for thousands of objects which can be used as ground truth. This will be most helpful when we want to segment objects belonging to a single class.\n\n## Models Available Under the Open Source Project\n\nThe SAM pretrained weights are available under \u301039\u2020segment-anything\u2020github.com\u3011 open source project.\n\nAs of now, there are model weights available for three different scales of Vision Transformer models.\n\n  * ViT-B SAM\n  * ViT-L SAM\n  * ViT-H SAM\n\nThe project also has a pip installable command. You can install segment-anything using the following command.\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git`\n\nIn the next section, we will use the official SAM weights and model to run inference on a few images. This will help us capture the exact capabilities of SAM.\n\nBefore that, you will need to download the models. You can find all the official model weights in the \u301040\u2020official repository\u2020github.com\u3011.\n\nOr you can use the command line if you are using Linux environment.\n\n`wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth\u00a0`\n\nWe will use the SAM-ViT-H (Huge) model for inference.\n\n## Inference using SAM\n\nHere, we will follow the code for running inference using a Python script.

It is a single model that can easily perform both interactive segmentation and automatic segmentation. The model\u2019s promptable interface (described shortly) allows it to be used in flexible ways that make a wide range of segmentation tasks possible simply by engineering the right prompt for the model (clicks, boxes, text, and so on). Moreover, SAM is trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset of over 1 billion masks (collected as part of this project), which enables it to generalize to new types of objects and images beyond what it observed during training. This ability to generalize means that, by and large, practitioners will no longer need to collect their own segmentation data and fine-tune a model for their use case. \n\nTaken together, these capabilities enable SAM to generalize both to new tasks and to new domains. This flexibility is the first of its kind for image segmentation. \n\nHere is a short video showcasing some of SAM\u2019s capabilities: \n\n[Image 8]\n\nSomething Went Wrong\n\nWe&#x27;re having trouble playing this video.\n\n\u30106\u2020Learn more\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n\n(1) SAM allows users to segment objects with just a click or by interactively clicking points to include and exclude from the object. The model can also be prompted with a bounding box. \n\n(2) SAM can output multiple valid masks when faced with ambiguity about the object being segmented, an important and necessary capability for solving segmentation in the real world. \n\n(3) SAM can automatically find and mask all objects in an image. \n\n(4) SAM can generate a segmentation mask for any prompt in real time after precomputing the image embedding, allowing for real-time interaction with the model. \n\n## How SAM works: Promptable segmentation\n\nIn natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision, one of the most exciting developments is that of foundation models that can perform zero-shot and few-shot learning for new datasets and tasks using \u201cprompting\u201d techniques. We took inspiration from this line of work. \n\nWe trained SAM to return a valid segmentation mask for any prompt, where a prompt can be foreground/background points, a rough box or mask, freeform text, or, in general, any information indicating what to segment in an image. The requirement of a valid mask simply means that even when a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects (for example, a point on a shirt may indicate either the shirt or the person wearing it), the output should be a reasonable mask for one of those objects. This task is used to pretrain the model and to solve general downstream segmentation tasks via prompting. \n\nWe observed that the pretraining task and interactive data collection imposed specific constraints on the model design. In particular, the model needs to run in real time on a CPU in a web browser to allow our annotators to use SAM interactively in real time to annotate efficiently. While the runtime constraint implies a trade-off between quality and runtime, we find that a simple design yields good results in practice. \n\nUnder the hood, an image encoder produces a one-time embedding for the image, while a lightweight encoder converts any prompt into an embedding vector in real time. These two information sources are then combined in a lightweight decoder that predicts segmentation masks. After the image embedding is computed, SAM can produce a segment in just 50 milliseconds given any prompt in a web browser. \n\n[Image 9]\n\nIn a web browser, SAM efficiently maps the image features and a set of prompt embeddings to produce a segmentation mask. \n\n## Segmenting 1 billion masks: How we built SA-1B\n\nTo train our model, we needed a massive and diverse source of data, which did not exist at the start of our work. The segmentation dataset we are releasing today is the largest to date (by far). The data was collected using SAM. In particular, annotators used SAM to interactively annotate images, and then the newly annotated data was used to update SAM in turn. We repeated this cycle many times to iteratively improve both the model and dataset. \n\nWith SAM, collecting new segmentation masks is faster than ever before. With our tool, it only takes about 14 seconds to interactively annotate a mask. Our per-mask annotation process is only 2x slower than annotating bounding boxes, which takes about 7 seconds using the fastest annotation interfaces. In comparison with previous large-scale segmentation data collection efforts, our model is 6.5x faster than COCO fully manual polygon-based mask annotation and 2x faster than the previous largest data annotation effort, which was also model-assisted. \n\nHowever, relying on interactively annotating masks does not scale sufficiently to create our 1 billion mask dataset. Therefore, we built a data engine for creating our SA-1B dataset. This data engine has three \u201cgears.\u201d In the first gear, the model assists annotators, as described above. The second gear is a mix of fully automatic annotation combined with assisted annotation, helping increase the diversity of collected masks. The last gear of the data engine is fully automatic mask creation, allowing our dataset to scale. \n\nOur final dataset includes more than 1.1 billion segmentation masks collected on about 11 million licensed and privacy-preserving images. SA-1B has 400x more masks than any existing segmentation dataset, and as verified by human evaluation studies, the masks are of high quality and diversity, and in some cases even comparable in quality to masks from the previous much smaller, fully manually annotated datasets. \n\n[Image 10][Image 11]\n\nSegment Anything\u2019s capabilities are the result of training on millions of images and masks collected using a data engine.

SA-1B is an unparalleled, high-quality resource curated specifically for training segmentation models.\n\n[Image 26: SAM sourced images from a wide geographic distribution.][Image 27: SAM sourced images from a wide geographic distribution.]To enhance versatility and avoid inherent training bias, SAM sourced images from a wide geographic distribution.\n\nCreating this dataset took multiple stages of production:\n\n  * Assisted Manual: In this initial stage, human annotators work alongside the Segment Anything Model, ensuring that every mask in an image is accurately captured and annotated.\n  * Semi-Automatic: Annotators are tasked with focusing on areas where SAM is less confident, refining and supplementing the model\u2019s predictions.\n  * Full-Auto: SAM independently predicts segmentation masks in the final stage, showcasing its ability to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe vastness and variety of the SA-1B Dataset push the boundaries of what\u2019s achievable in AI research. Such a dataset enables more robust training, allowing models like SAM to handle an unprecedented range of image segmentation tasks with high accuracy. It provides a rich pool of data that enhances the model\u2019s learning, ensuring it can generalize well across different tasks and environments.\n\n### Segment Anything Model Applications \n\nAs a giant leap forward in image segmentation, SAM can be used in almost every possible application.\n\nHere are some of the applications in which SAM is already making waves:\n\n  * AI-Assisted Labeling:\u00a0SAM significantly streamlines the process of labeling images.

The Transformer architecture utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, significantly improving upon the efficiency and effectiveness of previous models like RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory units).\n\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 extend this architecture by increasing the number of transformer layers, attention heads, and parameters. GPT-3.5 has 175 billion parameters, while GPT-4, although its exact size has not been publicly disclosed by OpenAI, is believed to significantly exceed this, reflecting its advanced capabilities. This massive scale allows the models to capture a deeper understanding of language nuances, context, and grammar.\n\nThe key architectural features include:\n\n- **Adaptive Attention Span**: This feature allows the model to adjust the focus of its attention based on the task, improving efficiency and performance in understanding long-term dependencies.\n  \n- **Sparse Attention Patterns**: To manage computational demands, these models implement sparse attention mechanisms, enabling them to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data.\n\n- **Layer Normalization**: Applied within each transformer block to stabilize and accelerate the training process.\n\n### 3.2.5 Training\n\nThe training process for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 involves two main stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model learns from a diverse and extensive dataset comprising books, websites, and other text sources. This stage uses unsupervised learning, where the model predicts the next word in a sentence given the words that precede it.\n\nFine-tuning allows the model to specialize in particular tasks or domains. This stage involves supervised learning, where the model adjusts its parameters based on specific datasets and feedback to optimize its performance for targeted applications.\n\nOpenAI has utilized Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as part of the training process for GPT-4, enhancing its ability to generate responses that are aligned with human values and preferences. This method involves iteratively training the model using human feedback to guide the generation of higher-quality, more relevant outputs.\n\nThe ethical considerations in training involve careful dataset selection and filtering to minimize biases and ensure the model does not generate harmful or inappropriate content. OpenAI has implemented various safety measures, including toxicity filters and content moderation guidelines, to promote responsible use of its technology.\n\n### Sources:\n\n- Vaswani, A., et al.

New advances in the field have the potential to make AI more helpful for billions of people over the coming years. Since \u301061\u2020introducing Gemini 1.0\u3011, we\u2019ve been testing, refining and enhancing its capabilities.\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing our next-generation model: Gemini 1.5.\n\nGemini 1.5 delivers dramatically enhanced performance. It represents a step change in our approach, building upon research and engineering innovations across nearly every part of our foundation model development and infrastructure. This includes making Gemini 1.5 more efficient to train and serve, with a new \u301062\u2020Mixture-of-Experts\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 (MoE) architecture.\n\nThe first Gemini 1.5 model we\u2019re releasing for early testing is Gemini 1.5 Pro. It\u2019s a mid-size multimodal model, optimized for scaling across a wide-range of tasks, and \u301063\u2020performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra\u2020goo.gle\u3011, our largest model to date. It also introduces a breakthrough experimental feature in long-context understanding.\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro comes with a standard 128,000 token context window. But starting today, a limited group of developers and enterprise customers can try it with a context window of up to 1 million tokens via \u301059\u2020AI Studio\u2020aistudio.google.com\u3011 and \u301060\u2020Vertex AI\u2020cloud.google.com\u3011 in private preview.\n\nAs we roll out the full 1 million token context window, we\u2019re actively working on optimizations to improve latency, reduce computational requirements and enhance the user experience. We\u2019re excited for people to try this breakthrough capability, and we share more details on future availability below.\n\nThese continued advances in our next-generation models will open up new possibilities for people, developers and enterprises to create, discover and build using AI.\n\nVideo format not supported \n\nContext lengths of leading foundation models\n\n## Highly efficient architecture \n\nGemini 1.5 is built upon our leading research on \u301064\u2020Transformer\u2020blog.research.google\u3011 and \u301062\u2020MoE\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 architecture. While a traditional Transformer functions as one large neural network, MoE models are divided into smaller &quot;expert\u201d neural networks.\n\nDepending on the type of input given, MoE models learn to selectively activate only the most relevant expert pathways in its neural network. This specialization massively enhances the model\u2019s efficiency. Google has been an early adopter and pioneer of the MoE technique for deep learning through research such as \u301062\u2020Sparsely-Gated MoE\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301065\u2020GShard-Transformer\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301066\u2020Switch-Transformer,\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 \u301067\u2020M4\u2020blog.research.google\u3011 and more.\n\nOur latest innovations in model architecture allow Gemini 1.5 to learn complex tasks more quickly and maintain quality, while being more efficient to train and serve. These efficiencies are helping our teams iterate, train and deliver more advanced versions of Gemini faster than ever before, and we\u2019re working on further optimizations.\n\n## Greater context, more helpful capabilities \n\nAn AI model\u2019s \u201ccontext window\u201d is made up of tokens, which are the building blocks used for processing information. Tokens can be entire parts or subsections of words, images, videos, audio or code. The bigger a model\u2019s context window, the more information it can take in and process in a given prompt \u2014 making its output more consistent, relevant and useful.\n\nThrough a series of machine learning innovations, we\u2019ve increased 1.5 Pro\u2019s context window capacity far beyond the original 32,000 tokens for Gemini 1.0. We can now run up to 1 million tokens in production.\n\nThis means 1.5 Pro can process vast amounts of information in one go \u2014 including 1 hour of video, 11 hours of audio, codebases with over 30,000 lines of code or over 700,000 words. In our research, we\u2019ve also successfully tested up to 10 million tokens.\n\n### Complex reasoning about vast amounts of information \n\n1.5 Pro can seamlessly analyze, classify and summarize large amounts of content within a given prompt. For example, when given the 402-page transcripts from Apollo 11\u2019s mission to the moon, it can reason about conversations, events and details found across the document.\n\n[Image 1: Reasoning across a 402-page transcript: Gemini 1.5 Pro Demo] \n\n10:25\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro can understand, reason about and identify curious details in the 402-page transcripts from Apollo 11\u2019s mission to the moon.\n\n### Better understanding and reasoning across modalities \n\n1.5 Pro can perform highly-sophisticated understanding and reasoning tasks for different modalities, including video. For instance, when given a 44-minute silent \u301068\u2020Buster Keaton movie\u2020www.youtube.com\u3011, the model can accurately analyze various plot points and events, and even reason about small details in the movie that could easily be missed.\n\n[Image 2: Multimodal prompting with a 44-minute movie: Gemini 1.5 Pro Demo] \n\n10:25\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro can identify a scene in a 44-minute silent Buster Keaton movie when given a simple line drawing as reference material for a real-life object.\n\n### Relevant problem-solving with longer blocks of code \n\n1.5 Pro can perform more relevant problem-solving tasks across longer blocks of code.

This new large language model is integrated across Google&#x27;s vast array of products, offering improvements that ripple through services and tools used by millions.\n\nGemini, Google&#x27;s advanced multimodal AI, is birthed from the collaborative efforts of the unified DeepMind and Brain AI labs. Gemini stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, promising to deliver a more interconnected and intelligent suite of applications.\n\nThe announcement of Google Gemini, nestled closely after the debut of Bard, Duet AI, and the PaLM 2 LLM, marks a clear intention from Google to not only compete but lead in the AI revolution.\n\nContrary to any notions of an AI winter, the launch of Gemini suggests a thriving AI spring, teeming with potential and growth. As we reflect on a year since the emergence of ChatGPT, which itself was a groundbreaking moment for AI, Google&#x27;s move indicates that the industry&#x27;s expansion is far from over; in fact, it may just be picking up pace.\n\n## What is Gemini?\n\nGoogle&#x27;s Gemini model is capable of processing diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. It comes in three versions\u2014Ultra, Pro, and Nano\u2014each tailored for specific applications, from complex reasoning to on-device use. Ultra excels in multifaceted tasks and will be available on Bard Advanced, while Pro offers a balance of performance and resource efficiency, already integrated into Bard for text prompts. Nano, optimized for on-device deployment, comes in two sizes and features hardware optimizations like 4-bit quantization for offline use in devices like the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nGemini&#x27;s architecture is unique in its native multimodal output capability, using discrete image tokens for image generation and integrating audio features from the Universal Speech Model for nuanced audio understanding. Its ability to handle video data as sequential images, interweaved with text or audio inputs, exemplifies its multimodal prowess.\n\n[Image 4: Gemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs]\n\nGemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs \n\nAccessing Gemini \n\nGemini 1.0 is rolling out across Google&#x27;s ecosystem, including Bard, which now benefits from the refined capabilities of Gemini Pro. Google has also integrated Gemini into its Search, Ads, and Duet services, enhancing user experience with faster, more accurate responses.\n\nFor those keen on harnessing the capabilities of Gemini, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex offer access to Gemini Pro, with the latter providing greater customization and security features.\n\nTo experience the enhanced capabilities of Bard powered by Gemini Pro, users can take the following straightforward steps:\n\n  1. Navigate to Bard: Open your preferred web browser and go to the Bard website.\n  2. Secure Login: Access the service by signing in with your Google account, assuring a seamless and secure experience.\n  3. Interactive Chat: You can now use Bard, where Gemini Pro&#x27;s advanced features can be opted.\n\nPower of Multimodality:\n\nAt its core, Gemini utilizes a transformer-based architecture, similar to those employed in successful NLP models like GPT-3. However, Gemini&#x27;s uniqueness lies in its ability to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and code. This is achieved through a novel technique called cross-modal attention, which allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between different types of data.\n\nHere&#x27;s a breakdown of Gemini&#x27;s key components:\n\n  * Multimodal Encoder:\u00a0This module processes the input data from each modality (e.g.,\u00a0text,\u00a0image) independently,\u00a0extracting relevant features and generating individual representations.\n  * Cross-modal Attention Network:\u00a0This network is the heart of Gemini.\u00a0It allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between the different representations,\u00a0enabling them to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and enrich their understanding.\n  * Multimodal Decoder:\u00a0This module utilizes the enriched representations generated by the cross-modal attention network to perform various tasks,\u00a0such as image captioning,\u00a0text-to-image generation,\u00a0and code generation.\n\nGemini model isn&#x27;t just about understanding text or images\u2014it&#x27;s about integrating different kinds of information in a way that&#x27;s much closer to how we, as humans, perceive the world. For instance, Gemini can look at a sequence of images and determine the logical or spatial order of objects within them. It can also analyze the design features of objects to make judgments, such as which of two cars has a more aerodynamic shape.\n\nBut Gemini&#x27;s talents go beyond just visual understanding. It can turn a set of instructions into code, creating practical tools like a countdown timer that not only functions as directed but also includes creative elements, such as motivational emojis, to enhance user interaction. This indicates an ability to handle tasks that require a blend of creativity and functionality\u2014skills that are often considered distinctly human.\n\n[Image 5: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning (\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\n[Image 6: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks(\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\nGemini sophisticated design is based on a rich history of neural network research and leverages Google\u2019s cutting-edge TPU technology for training. Gemini Ultra, in particular, has set new benchmarks in various AI domains, showcasing remarkable performance lifts in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nWith its ability to parse through and understand complex data, Gemini offers solutions for real-world applications, especially in education. It can analyze and correct solutions to problems, like in physics, by understanding handwritten notes and providing accurate mathematical typesetting. Such capabilities suggest a future where AI assists in educational settings, offering students and educators advanced tools for learning and problem-solving.\n\nGemini&#x27;s has been leveraged to create agents like AlphaCode 2, which excels at competitive programming problems. This showcases Gemini&#x27;s potential to act as a generalist AI, capable of handling complex, multi-step problems.\n\nGemini Nano brings the power of AI to everyday devices, maintaining impressive abilities in tasks like summarization and reading comprehension, as well as coding and STEM-related challenges. These smaller models are fine-tuned to offer high-quality AI functionalities on lower-memory devices, making advanced AI more accessible than ever.\n\nThe development of Gemini involved innovations in training algorithms and infrastructure, using Google\u2019s latest TPUs. This allowed for efficient scaling and robust training processes, ensuring that even the smallest models deliver exceptional performance.\n\nThe training dataset for Gemini is as diverse as its capabilities, including web documents, books, code, images, audio, and videos. This multimodal and multilingual dataset ensures that Gemini models can understand and process a wide variety of content types effectively.\n\nGemini and GPT-4 \n\nDespite the emergence of other models, the question on everyone&#x27;s mind is how Google&#x27;s Gemini stacks up against OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4, the industry&#x27;s benchmark for new LLMs. Google&#x27;s data suggest that while GPT-4 may excel in commonsense reasoning tasks, Gemini Ultra has the upper hand in almost every other area.\n\n[Image 7: Gemini VS GPT-4]\n\nGemini VS GPT-4 \n\nThe above benchmarking table shows the impressive performance of Google&#x27;s Gemini AI across a variety of tasks.

This design facilitates the handling of text, images, video sequences, and audio, all within the same context window, enabling a genuinely multimodal interaction capability\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe Gemini 1.5 Pro model introduces a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, pushing the boundaries with a context length of &quot;multiple millions,&quot; allowing it to process vast amounts of information at once. This MoE architecture divides the model into smaller &quot;expert&quot; neural networks that activate selectively based on the input, massively enhancing efficiency and allowing Gemini to learn complex tasks more quickly while maintaining high quality\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Performance and Capabilities\n\nGemini Ultra has outperformed other leading models, including GPT-4, in a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating superior capabilities in tasks requiring deep multimodal understanding and reasoning. For instance, Gemini Ultra excels in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) test, scoring 90%, a first for a model to outperform human experts across its 57 subjects\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\nGemini&#x27;s training involves a multimodal and multilingual dataset, including web documents, books, code, and multimedia content like images, audio, and video, which ensures its proficiency across a broad range of content types. The use of Google&#x27;s cutting-edge TPU technology for training underlines the model&#x27;s innovative underpinnings, contributing to its efficiency and effectiveness\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nThe introduction of Gemini has the potential to revolutionize various domains by offering advanced solutions for real-world applications. For instance, in education, Gemini can analyze and provide accurate feedback on complex problems, indicating a future where AI assists in creating more interactive and personalized learning experiences\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\nMoreover, Google has begun integrating Gemini across its ecosystem, including services like Bard, Google Search, and Ads, enhancing the user experience with faster, more accurate responses. The rollout of Gemini models across Google&#x27;s products signifies the company&#x27;s intent to harness the power of AI to improve and innovate across its services\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn conclusion, Google&#x27;s Gemini represents a pioneering advancement in AI, with its unique architecture, exceptional performance, and the potential for widespread application across various industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it&#x27;s clear that Google is positioning Gemini at the forefront of the AI revolution, challenging existing paradigms and setting new standards for what AI can achieve."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [{"start_ix": 969, "end_ix": 980, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Gemini (language model) - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(language_model)", "text": "\nGemini Ultra was said to have outperformed GPT-4, \u3010114\u2020Anthropic\u3011&#x27;s \u3010115\u2020Claude 2\u3011, \u3010116\u2020Inflection AI\u3011&#x27;s Inflection-2, \u3010117\u2020Meta\u3011&#x27;s \u3010118\u2020LLaMA 2\u3011, and \u3010119\u2020xAI\u3011&#x27;s \u3010120\u2020Grok 1\u3011 on a variety of industry benchmarks,[20][13] while Gemini Pro was said to have outperformed \u3010121\u2020GPT-3.5\u3011.[3] Gemini Ultra was also the first language model to outperform human experts on the 57-subject Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) test, obtaining a score of 90%.[3][19] Gemini Pro was made available to Google Cloud customers on AI Studio and Vertex AI on December 13, while Gemini Nano will be made available to \u3010122\u2020Android\u3011 developers as well.[21][22][23] Hassabis further revealed that DeepMind was exploring how Gemini could be &quot;combined with robotics to physically interact with the world&quot;.[24] In accordance with \u3010123\u2020an executive order\u3011 signed by U.S. President \u3010124\u2020Joe Biden\u3011 in October, Google stated that it would share testing results of Gemini Ultra with the \u3010125\u2020federal government of the United States\u3011. Similarly, the company was engaged in discussions with the \u3010126\u2020government of the United Kingdom\u3011 to comply with the principles laid out at the \u3010127\u2020AI Safety Summit\u3011 at \u3010128\u2020Bletchley Park\u3011 in November.[3]\n\n### Updates[\u3010129\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nGoogle partnered with \u3010130\u2020Samsung\u3011 to integrate Gemini Nano and Gemini Pro into its \u3010131\u2020Galaxy S24\u3011 smartphone lineup in January 2024.[25][26] The following month, Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand,[27][28] with &quot;Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0&quot; debuting via a new &quot;AI Premium&quot; tier of the \u3010132\u2020Google One\u3011 subscription service.[29] Gemini Pro also received a global launch.[30]\n\nIn February, Google launched &quot;Gemini 1.5&quot; in a limited capacity, positioned as a more powerful and capable model than 1.0 Ultra.[31][32][33] This &quot;step change&quot; was achieved through various technical advancements, including a new architecture, a \u3010133\u2020mixture-of-experts\u3011 approach, and a larger one-million-token \u3010134\u2020context window\u3011, which equates to roughly an hour of silent video, 11\u00a0hours of audio, 30,000\u00a0lines of code, or 700,000\u00a0words.[34] The same month, Google debuted Gemma, a family of \u3010135\u2020free and open-source\u3011 LLMs that serve as a lightweight version of Gemini. They come in two sizes, with a neural network with two and seven\u00a0billion parameters, respectively. Multiple publications viewed this as an response to Meta and others open-sourcing their AI models, and a stark reversal from Google&#x27;s longstanding practice of keeping its AI proprietary.[35][36][37]\n\n## Technical specifications[\u3010136\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nThe first generation of Gemini (&quot;Gemini 1&quot;) has three models, with the same \u3010137\u2020software architecture\u3011. They are decoder-only \u3010138\u2020transformers\u3011, with modifications to allow efficient training and inference on TPUs. They have a context length of 32,768 tokens, with multi-query attention. Two versions of Gemini Nano, Nano-1 (1.8\u00a0billion parameters) and Nano-2 (3.25\u00a0billion parameters), are distilled from larger Gemini models, designed for use by \u3010139\u2020edge devices\u3011 such as smartphones. As Gemini is multimodal, each context window can contain multiple forms of input. The different modes can be interleaved and do not have to be presented in a fixed order, allowing for a multimodal conversation. Input images may be of different \u3010140\u2020resolutions\u3011, while video is inputted as a sequence of images. Audio is sampled at 16 \u3010141\u2020kHz\u3011 and then converted into a sequence of tokens by the Universal Speech Model. Gemini&#x27;s dataset is multimodal and multilingual, consisting of &quot;web documents, books, and code, and includ[ing] image, audio, and video data&quot;.[38]\n\nDemis Hassabis claims that training Gemini 1 used &quot;roughly the same amount of compute, maybe slightly more than what was rumored for GPT-4&quot;.[39]\n\nThe second generation of Gemini (&quot;Gemini 1.5&quot;) has one model published so far: Gemini 1.5 Pro. It is a multimodal \u3010142\u2020sparse mixture-of-experts\u3011, with context length of &quot;multiple millions&quot;.[40]\n\n## Reception[\u3010143\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nGemini&#x27;s launch was preluded by months of intense speculation and anticipation, which \u3010144\u2020MIT Technology Review\u3011 described as &quot;peak AI hype&quot;.[41][20] In August 2023, Dylan Patel and Daniel Nishball of research firm SemiAnalysis penned a \u3010145\u2020blog post\u3011 declaring that the release of Gemini would &quot;eat the world&quot; and outclass GPT-4, prompting OpenAI CEO \u3010146\u2020Sam Altman\u3011 to ridicule the duo on \u3010147\u2020X\u3011 (formerly Twitter).[42][43] Business magnate \u3010148\u2020Elon Musk\u3011, who co-founded OpenAI, weighed in, asking, &quot;Are the numbers wrong?&quot;[44] Hugh Langley of \u3010149\u2020Business Insider\u3011 remarked that Gemini would be a make-or-break moment for Google, writing: &quot;If Gemini dazzles, it will help Google change the narrative that it was blindsided by Microsoft and OpenAI. If it disappoints, it will embolden critics who say Google has fallen behind.&quot;[45]\n\nReacting to its unveiling in December 2023, \u3010150\u2020University of Washington\u3011 professor emeritus \u3010151\u2020Oren Etzioni\u3011 predicted a &quot;tit-for-tat \u3010152\u2020arms race\u3011&quot; between Google and OpenAI. Professor \u3010153\u2020Alexei Efros\u3011 of the \u3010154\u2020University of California, Berkeley\u3011 praised the potential of Gemini&#x27;s multimodal approach,[19] while scientist \u3010155\u2020Melanie Mitchell\u3011 of the \u3010156\u2020Santa Fe Institute\u3011 called Gemini &quot;very sophisticated&quot;. Professor Chirag Shah of the University of Washington was less impressed, likening Gemini&#x27;s launch to the routineness of \u3010157\u2020Apple\u3011&#x27;s \u3010158\u2020annual introduction\u3011 of a new \u3010159\u2020iPhone\u3011. Similarly, \u3010160\u2020Stanford University\u3011&#x27;s Percy Liang, the University of Washington&#x27;s \u3010161\u2020Emily Bender\u3011, and the \u3010162\u2020University of Galway\u3011&#x27;s Michael Madden cautioned that it was difficult to interpret benchmark scores without insight into the training data used.[41][46] Writing for \u3010163\u2020Fast Company\u3011, Mark Sullivan opined that Google had the opportunity to challenge the iPhone&#x27;s dominant market share, believing that Apple was unlikely to have the capacity to develop functionality similar to Gemini with its \u3010164\u2020Siri\u3011 \u3010165\u2020virtual assistant\u3011.[47] Google shares spiked by 5.3\u00a0percent the day after Gemini&#x27;s launch.[48][49]\n\nGoogle faced criticism for a demonstrative video of Gemini, which was not conducted in real time.[50]\n\n## See also[\u3010166\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * \u3010167\u2020Gato\u3011, a multimodal neural network developed by DeepMind\n\n## References[\u3010168\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  1. ^ Grant, Nico (May 10, 2023). \u3010169\u2020&quot;Google Builds on Tech&#x27;s Latest Craze With Its Own A.I.

Today, developers and Cloud customers can begin building with 1.0 Ultra too \u2014 with our Gemini API in \u301059\u2020AI Studio\u2020aistudio.google.com\u3011 and in \u301060\u2020Vertex AI\u2020cloud.google.com\u3011.\n\nOur teams continue pushing the frontiers of our latest models with safety at the core. They are making rapid progress. In fact, we\u2019re ready to introduce the next generation: Gemini 1.5. It shows dramatic improvements across a number of dimensions and 1.5 Pro achieves comparable quality to 1.0 Ultra, while using less compute.\n\nThis new generation also delivers a breakthrough in long-context understanding. We\u2019ve been able to significantly increase the amount of information our models can process \u2014 running up to 1 million tokens consistently, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet.\n\nLonger context windows show us the promise of what is possible. They will enable entirely new capabilities and help developers build much more useful models and applications. We\u2019re excited to offer a limited preview of this experimental feature to developers and enterprise customers. Demis shares more on capabilities, safety and availability below.\n\n\u2014 Sundar\n\n## Introducing Gemini 1.5 \n\nBy Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team \n\nThis is an exciting time for AI. New advances in the field have the potential to make AI more helpful for billions of people over the coming years. Since \u301061\u2020introducing Gemini 1.0\u3011, we\u2019ve been testing, refining and enhancing its capabilities.\n\nToday, we\u2019re announcing our next-generation model: Gemini 1.5.\n\nGemini 1.5 delivers dramatically enhanced performance. It represents a step change in our approach, building upon research and engineering innovations across nearly every part of our foundation model development and infrastructure. This includes making Gemini 1.5 more efficient to train and serve, with a new \u301062\u2020Mixture-of-Experts\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 (MoE) architecture.\n\nThe first Gemini 1.5 model we\u2019re releasing for early testing is Gemini 1.5 Pro. It\u2019s a mid-size multimodal model, optimized for scaling across a wide-range of tasks, and \u301063\u2020performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra\u2020goo.gle\u3011, our largest model to date. It also introduces a breakthrough experimental feature in long-context understanding.\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro comes with a standard 128,000 token context window. But starting today, a limited group of developers and enterprise customers can try it with a context window of up to 1 million tokens via \u301059\u2020AI Studio\u2020aistudio.google.com\u3011 and \u301060\u2020Vertex AI\u2020cloud.google.com\u3011 in private preview.\n\nAs we roll out the full 1 million token context window, we\u2019re actively working on optimizations to improve latency, reduce computational requirements and enhance the user experience. We\u2019re excited for people to try this breakthrough capability, and we share more details on future availability below.\n\nThese continued advances in our next-generation models will open up new possibilities for people, developers and enterprises to create, discover and build using AI.\n\nVideo format not supported \n\nContext lengths of leading foundation models\n\n## Highly efficient architecture \n\nGemini 1.5 is built upon our leading research on \u301064\u2020Transformer\u2020blog.research.google\u3011 and \u301062\u2020MoE\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 architecture. While a traditional Transformer functions as one large neural network, MoE models are divided into smaller &quot;expert\u201d neural networks.\n\nDepending on the type of input given, MoE models learn to selectively activate only the most relevant expert pathways in its neural network. This specialization massively enhances the model\u2019s efficiency. Google has been an early adopter and pioneer of the MoE technique for deep learning through research such as \u301062\u2020Sparsely-Gated MoE\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301065\u2020GShard-Transformer\u2020arxiv.org\u3011, \u301066\u2020Switch-Transformer,\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 \u301067\u2020M4\u2020blog.research.google\u3011 and more.\n\nOur latest innovations in model architecture allow Gemini 1.5 to learn complex tasks more quickly and maintain quality, while being more efficient to train and serve. These efficiencies are helping our teams iterate, train and deliver more advanced versions of Gemini faster than ever before, and we\u2019re working on further optimizations.\n\n## Greater context, more helpful capabilities \n\nAn AI model\u2019s \u201ccontext window\u201d is made up of tokens, which are the building blocks used for processing information. Tokens can be entire parts or subsections of words, images, videos, audio or code. The bigger a model\u2019s context window, the more information it can take in and process in a given prompt \u2014 making its output more consistent, relevant and useful.\n\nThrough a series of machine learning innovations, we\u2019ve increased 1.5 Pro\u2019s context window capacity far beyond the original 32,000 tokens for Gemini 1.0. We can now run up to 1 million tokens in production.\n\nThis means 1.5 Pro can process vast amounts of information in one go \u2014 including 1 hour of video, 11 hours of audio, codebases with over 30,000 lines of code or over 700,000 words. In our research, we\u2019ve also successfully tested up to 10 million tokens.\n\n### Complex reasoning about vast amounts of information \n\n1.5 Pro can seamlessly analyze, classify and summarize large amounts of content within a given prompt.

This new large language model is integrated across Google&#x27;s vast array of products, offering improvements that ripple through services and tools used by millions.\n\nGemini, Google&#x27;s advanced multimodal AI, is birthed from the collaborative efforts of the unified DeepMind and Brain AI labs. Gemini stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, promising to deliver a more interconnected and intelligent suite of applications.\n\nThe announcement of Google Gemini, nestled closely after the debut of Bard, Duet AI, and the PaLM 2 LLM, marks a clear intention from Google to not only compete but lead in the AI revolution.\n\nContrary to any notions of an AI winter, the launch of Gemini suggests a thriving AI spring, teeming with potential and growth. As we reflect on a year since the emergence of ChatGPT, which itself was a groundbreaking moment for AI, Google&#x27;s move indicates that the industry&#x27;s expansion is far from over; in fact, it may just be picking up pace.\n\n## What is Gemini?\n\nGoogle&#x27;s Gemini model is capable of processing diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video. It comes in three versions\u2014Ultra, Pro, and Nano\u2014each tailored for specific applications, from complex reasoning to on-device use. Ultra excels in multifaceted tasks and will be available on Bard Advanced, while Pro offers a balance of performance and resource efficiency, already integrated into Bard for text prompts. Nano, optimized for on-device deployment, comes in two sizes and features hardware optimizations like 4-bit quantization for offline use in devices like the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nGemini&#x27;s architecture is unique in its native multimodal output capability, using discrete image tokens for image generation and integrating audio features from the Universal Speech Model for nuanced audio understanding. Its ability to handle video data as sequential images, interweaved with text or audio inputs, exemplifies its multimodal prowess.\n\n[Image 4: Gemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs]\n\nGemini supports sequences of text, image, audio, and video as inputs \n\nAccessing Gemini \n\nGemini 1.0 is rolling out across Google&#x27;s ecosystem, including Bard, which now benefits from the refined capabilities of Gemini Pro. Google has also integrated Gemini into its Search, Ads, and Duet services, enhancing user experience with faster, more accurate responses.\n\nFor those keen on harnessing the capabilities of Gemini, Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Vertex offer access to Gemini Pro, with the latter providing greater customization and security features.\n\nTo experience the enhanced capabilities of Bard powered by Gemini Pro, users can take the following straightforward steps:\n\n  1. Navigate to Bard: Open your preferred web browser and go to the Bard website.\n  2. Secure Login: Access the service by signing in with your Google account, assuring a seamless and secure experience.\n  3. Interactive Chat: You can now use Bard, where Gemini Pro&#x27;s advanced features can be opted.\n\nPower of Multimodality:\n\nAt its core, Gemini utilizes a transformer-based architecture, similar to those employed in successful NLP models like GPT-3. However, Gemini&#x27;s uniqueness lies in its ability to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and code. This is achieved through a novel technique called cross-modal attention, which allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between different types of data.\n\nHere&#x27;s a breakdown of Gemini&#x27;s key components:\n\n  * Multimodal Encoder:\u00a0This module processes the input data from each modality (e.g.,\u00a0text,\u00a0image) independently,\u00a0extracting relevant features and generating individual representations.\n  * Cross-modal Attention Network:\u00a0This network is the heart of Gemini.\u00a0It allows the model to learn relationships and dependencies between the different representations,\u00a0enabling them to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and enrich their understanding.\n  * Multimodal Decoder:\u00a0This module utilizes the enriched representations generated by the cross-modal attention network to perform various tasks,\u00a0such as image captioning,\u00a0text-to-image generation,\u00a0and code generation.\n\nGemini model isn&#x27;t just about understanding text or images\u2014it&#x27;s about integrating different kinds of information in a way that&#x27;s much closer to how we, as humans, perceive the world. For instance, Gemini can look at a sequence of images and determine the logical or spatial order of objects within them. It can also analyze the design features of objects to make judgments, such as which of two cars has a more aerodynamic shape.\n\nBut Gemini&#x27;s talents go beyond just visual understanding. It can turn a set of instructions into code, creating practical tools like a countdown timer that not only functions as directed but also includes creative elements, such as motivational emojis, to enhance user interaction. This indicates an ability to handle tasks that require a blend of creativity and functionality\u2014skills that are often considered distinctly human.\n\n[Image 5: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities : Spatial Reasoning (\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\n[Image 6: Gemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks]\n\nGemini&#x27;s capabilities extend to executing programming tasks(\u301083\u2020Source\u2020developers.googleblog.com\u3011)\n\nGemini sophisticated design is based on a rich history of neural network research and leverages Google\u2019s cutting-edge TPU technology for training. Gemini Ultra, in particular, has set new benchmarks in various AI domains, showcasing remarkable performance lifts in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nWith its ability to parse through and understand complex data, Gemini offers solutions for real-world applications, especially in education. It can analyze and correct solutions to problems, like in physics, by understanding handwritten notes and providing accurate mathematical typesetting. Such capabilities suggest a future where AI assists in educational settings, offering students and educators advanced tools for learning and problem-solving.\n\nGemini&#x27;s has been leveraged to create agents like AlphaCode 2, which excels at competitive programming problems. This showcases Gemini&#x27;s potential to act as a generalist AI, capable of handling complex, multi-step problems.\n\nGemini Nano brings the power of AI to everyday devices, maintaining impressive abilities in tasks like summarization and reading comprehension, as well as coding and STEM-related challenges. These smaller models are fine-tuned to offer high-quality AI functionalities on lower-memory devices, making advanced AI more accessible than ever.\n\nThe development of Gemini involved innovations in training algorithms and infrastructure, using Google\u2019s latest TPUs. This allowed for efficient scaling and robust training processes, ensuring that even the smallest models deliver exceptional performance.\n\nThe training dataset for Gemini is as diverse as its capabilities, including web documents, books, code, images, audio, and videos. This multimodal and multilingual dataset ensures that Gemini models can understand and process a wide variety of content types effectively.\n\nGemini and GPT-4 \n\nDespite the emergence of other models, the question on everyone&#x27;s mind is how Google&#x27;s Gemini stacks up against OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4, the industry&#x27;s benchmark for new LLMs. Google&#x27;s data suggest that while GPT-4 may excel in commonsense reasoning tasks, Gemini Ultra has the upper hand in almost every other area.\n\n[Image 7: Gemini VS GPT-4]\n\nGemini VS GPT-4 \n\nThe above benchmarking table shows the impressive performance of Google&#x27;s Gemini AI across a variety of tasks.

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n### 1. Define Your Requirements\n- **Understand the Scope**: Determine what your service needs to do. This includes understanding the data it needs to handle, the kind of requests it will serve, and any specific functionalities or integrations it should have.\n- **Identify the Users**: Know who will use your service and in what ways. This can affect your design choices significantly.\n\n### 2. Plan Your Application Architecture\n- **Choose an Architecture Style**: Common styles include monolithic, microservices, and serverless. Your choice depends on your project&#x27;s scale, team size, and specific needs.\n- **Design Your Database Schema**: Decide on the types of data you&#x27;ll store and how they relate to each other. This will help you choose the right database system (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL).\n\n### 3. Select the Right Tools and Frameworks\n- **Web Frameworks**: Python offers several frameworks for developing web backends. Popular ones include Django (great for larger applications with its built-in features) and Flask (a lightweight option offering more flexibility).\n- **Database**: Choose a database that fits your data needs. PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB are common choices.\n- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Tools like SQLAlchemy (for SQL databases) and MongoEngine (for MongoDB) can make database interactions easier and more Pythonic.\n- **API Development**: Consider using REST or GraphQL for your API. Flask-RESTful, Django REST Framework, and Graphene (for GraphQL) are useful tools.\n\n### 4. Set Up Your Development Environment\n- **Version Control**: Use Git and host your code on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.\n- **Virtual Environment**: Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create isolated Python environments for your project.\n- **Dependency Management**: Use `pip` for package management and `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` (when using Pipenv) to track your dependencies.\n\n### 5. Implement Your Application\n- **Start Coding**: Follow the documentation of the frameworks and libraries you&#x27;ve chosen. Begin with setting up your project&#x27;s structure, then develop your models, views, and controllers/API endpoints.\n- **Testing**: Write tests as you go. Python&#x27;s `unittest` or third-party libraries like `pytest` can help ensure your code works as expected.\n\n### 6. Ensure Security and Performance\n- **Security**: Implement authentication, authorization, input validation, and other security best practices.\n- **Performance**: Use caching, database indexing, and other techniques to optimize the performance of your service.\n\n### 7. Deployment\n- **Choose a Hosting Service**: Options include traditional web hosts, cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku, or serverless platforms if applicable.\n- **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.\n\n### 8. Continuous Monitoring and Updates\n- **Monitor Your Application**: Use tools to track errors, performance issues, and user activity in real-time.\n- **Iterate**: Continuously update your application based on user feedback and performance data.\n\n### 9. Learn and Adapt\n- Stay updated with the latest in Python development practices and tools. The Python community is vibrant and always evolving, offering plenty of resources and support for developers.\n\nThis is a simplified overview to get you started. Each step involves deeper knowledge and considerations, so be prepared to do further research and learning as you progress with your project."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2d204-2de3-423f-86b9-b8ae66c73bd3", "request_id": "85cb64ba9e498ac2-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2d204-2de3-423f-86b9-b8ae66c73bd3", "children": ["aaa2309a-ea2c-4ed2-a4b0-4b8f4f5a86a1"]}, "aaa2309a-ea2c-4ed2-a4b0-4b8f4f5a86a1": {"id": "aaa2309a-ea2c-4ed2-a4b0-4b8f4f5a86a1", "message": {"id": "aaa2309a-ea2c-4ed2-a4b0-4b8f4f5a86a1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709152005.485679, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["let&#x27;s start step by step, ask me the questions needed"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "85cb6780d8288ab3-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "5b3ebfa7-6bd6-4f71-b0b0-858c55da67b4", "children": ["ebfc47ed-084b-4300-aaea-9d36b1b314c9"]}, "ebfc47ed-084b-4300-aaea-9d36b1b314c9": {"id": "ebfc47ed-084b-4300-aaea-9d36b1b314c9", "message": {"id": "ebfc47ed-084b-4300-aaea-9d36b1b314c9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709152030.11657, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Let&#x27;s break down the initial steps to define your requirements and plan your application architecture.

Let&#x27;s summarize the key points and proceed to the next steps:\n\n### Summary of Requirements\n\n- **Purpose**: A mobile application backend to facilitate venue bookings for events such as weddings, birthdays, and graduation parties.\n- **Database**: Preference for an online database service. Familiarity with Firebase, but open to other suggestions.\n- **Traffic Expectations**: Initially low, as the service is just starting.\n- **User Types**: No distinct user roles mentioned; implying a straightforward user model for now.\n\n### Recommendations and Next Steps\n\n#### Database and Backend Services\nGiven your preference for an online database and starting scale:\n- **Firebase**: A solid choice for startups. It provides a comprehensive suite of backend services including a NoSQL database (Firestore), authentication, cloud functions, and hosting capabilities. Firebase&#x27;s real-time database features are particularly beneficial for booking systems where availability updates are crucial.\n- **Alternatives to Consider**:\n  - **AWS Amplify**: Offers a broad set of tools to build scalable mobile and web applications, including authentication, data storage, and serverless functions. It integrates well with other AWS services if you plan to scale or add more features in the future.\n  - **MongoDB Atlas**: A cloud database service that offers a flexible, scalable NoSQL database. It&#x27;s a good option if you prefer a document-oriented database and plan to handle diverse data types and structures.\n\n#### Application Architecture\nGiven the early stage of your project and the nature of your application:\n- **Monolithic Architecture**: Start with a simpler, monolithic architecture for faster development and easier maintenance in the early stages. This doesn&#x27;t preclude moving to a more distributed architecture, like microservices, as you scale.\n- **API Design**: Consider designing your backend as a RESTful API, which can easily interface with your mobile application and allows for flexibility in future frontend developments or integrations.\n\n#### Security and Authentication\n- With Firebase, you get built-in user authentication support, which can simplify the development process. Ensure that your application handles user data securely and complies with data protection regulations relevant to your user base.\n\n#### Development and Deployment\n- **Framework Choice**: For Python, frameworks like Flask or Django can be used to develop your backend. Flask is lightweight and offers more flexibility, which might be suitable for starting out.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step workflow to guide you through the process from start to finish:\n\n### A. Setup and Initial Planning\n1. **Define Requirements and Scope**: Clearly outline the features, functionalities, and user flows of your application. Document everything from user registration to venue booking processes.\n2. **Design Data Model**: Plan how your data will be structured in Firebase. This includes users, venues, bookings, and any other entities your application needs.\n\n### B. Environment Setup\n1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your development machine.\n2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Use `venv` to create an isolated Python environment for your project.\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n3. **Install Flask**: Install Flask and other necessary libraries within your virtual environment.\n   ```bash\n   pip install Flask\n   ```\n4. **Firebase Project**: Set up a new project in the Firebase console. Note your project&#x27;s credentials as you&#x27;ll need them to integrate Firebase with your Flask application.\n\n### C. Flask Application Structure\n1. **Initialize Your Flask App**: Create a new Flask application, organizing your project with models, views, and controllers.\n2. **Firebase Integration**:\n   - Install the Firebase Admin SDK in your Flask app.\n     ```bash\n     pip install firebase-admin\n     ```\n   - Initialize Firebase Admin with your project credentials in your Flask application.\n\n### D. Development\n1. **Authentication**:\n   - Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication. This includes registration, login, and session management.\n2. **Database Operations**:\n   - Use Firebase Firestore to manage venue and booking data. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your data models.\n3. **API Endpoints**:\n   - Design and implement RESTful endpoints for your application&#x27;s functionalities, such as listing venues, making bookings, and managing user accounts.\n4. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for your API endpoints to ensure reliability and functionality.\n\n### E. Security\n1. **Secure Your Firebase Service**: Configure Firebase rules for Firestore and Firebase Storage (if used) to ensure that data access is properly secured.\n2. **Flask Security Practices**: Implement necessary security practices in Flask, including securing API endpoints, validating inputs, and safely handling user data.\n\n### F. Deployment\n1. **Prepare for Deployment**: Ensure your application is production-ready by setting appropriate configuration settings for your Flask app and Firebase project.\n2. **Choose a Deployment Platform**: Select a platform that supports Flask applications. Options include Google Cloud App Engine, Heroku, or any server that supports Python applications.\n3. **Deploy Your Application**: Follow the deployment process for your chosen platform, making sure to properly configure environment variables for Firebase and other services.\n\n### G. Monitoring and Maintenance\n1. **Monitor Your Application**: Use Firebase&#x27;s built-in analytics and any other monitoring tools to keep track of your application&#x27;s performance and usage.\n2. **Iterate and Update**: Based on user feedback and monitoring insights, make necessary adjustments and updates to your application.\n\n### H. Documentation\n1. **Document Your API**: Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document your API endpoints, making it easier for frontend teams to integrate and for future backend updates.\n\nThis workflow provides a high-level overview of the process to develop your backend service using Firebase and Flask. Each step involves more detailed actions and considerations, so be prepared to delve into documentation and best practices for each tool and technology you use."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa27299-31e4-4246-8826-02a83225d53f", "request_id": "85cb82b76ef58ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa27299-31e4-4246-8826-02a83225d53f", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "3a6ace39-3cd3-4c66-88bb-c1339172a61a", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "e51b805a-5e34-4481-81de-5d0ff47eec27", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "id": "e51b805a-5e34-4481-81de-5d0ff47eec27"}, {"title": "Italy: Coordinates Near Lake", "create_time": 1708928458.877879, "update_time": 1708928522.364459, "mapping": {"7d27538a-96dd-40be-b6a9-2fa53feaa64e": {"id": "7d27538a-96dd-40be-b6a9-2fa53feaa64e", "message": {"id": "7d27538a-96dd-40be-b6a9-2fa53feaa64e", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa1554b-94e9-45ca-8259-aca5f20e1d5f", "children": ["aaa28590-9f6c-45e8-ae1f-60ed4e086676"]}, "aaa1554b-94e9-45ca-8259-aca5f20e1d5f": {"id": "aaa1554b-94e9-45ca-8259-aca5f20e1d5f", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["7d27538a-96dd-40be-b6a9-2fa53feaa64e"]}, "aaa28590-9f6c-45e8-ae1f-60ed4e086676": {"id": "aaa28590-9f6c-45e8-ae1f-60ed4e086676", "message": {"id": "aaa28590-9f6c-45e8-ae1f-60ed4e086676", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708928458.879088, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["where is this located; Before continuing with the analysis, I am only interested in a certain region which has the extent of 10.4635032126072485,45.4282622161035405 : 10.9692495178414191,45.9321245833442475 defined in EPSG:4326 - WGS 84, the images must be cropped to a bounding box enclosing this extent, it must be a rectangular bounding box."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "85b615d29a228aaf-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "7d27538a-96dd-40be-b6a9-2fa53feaa64e", "children": ["e36f6596-cabd-4a92-8d07-c22c907c9b15"]}, "e36f6596-cabd-4a92-8d07-c22c907c9b15": {"id": "e36f6596-cabd-4a92-8d07-c22c907c9b15", "message": {"id": "e36f6596-cabd-4a92-8d07-c22c907c9b15", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708928521.127783, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The coordinates you provided define a rectangular bounding box in the EPSG:4326 coordinate system, which uses the WGS 84 datum.

Then, you could use a GIS tool or an online map service like Google Maps to visualize the average median PM2.5 values for 2020 at each sensor location in Milan.\n\nIf you&#x27;d like to proceed with another type of analysis or have other questions, please let me know!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "44b8bc6c-5416-43ae-a6f1-1f2e56ca49e3", "request_id": "861869c63c4f8ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "44b8bc6c-5416-43ae-a6f1-1f2e56ca49e3", "children": ["aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7"]}, "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7": {"id": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "message": {"id": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709959522.404103, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["use the adress name of the sensors"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "86186a457a7b8ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "a0f0f1d5-28c0-4523-be8d-1e7fcc139ddb", "children": ["fec2bf51-dda8-4766-a0d0-359a864b48fe", "03e82b03-d886-4ca3-823b-3e556c21a2e3"]}, "fec2bf51-dda8-4766-a0d0-359a864b48fe": {"id": "fec2bf51-dda8-4766-a0d0-359a864b48fe", "message": {"id": "fec2bf51-dda8-4766-a0d0-359a864b48fe", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709959543.507013, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Given that we&#x27;re working with textual descriptions of sensor locations rather than precise geographic coordinates, the process of plotting these average median PM2.5 values on a map will be conceptual rather than precise. For the sake of this exercise, I&#x27;ll outline a methodology that could be employed in a real-world scenario to achieve this, bearing in mind the evolving nature of geospatial analysis and the tools available.\n\n1. **Geocoding**: The first step would involve geocoding the address names of the sensors. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates. This could be achieved through various APIs such as Google Maps Geocoding API, OpenStreetMap&#x27;s Nominatim, or other geospatial services. These platforms have extensive databases that map textual addresses to precise latitudes and longitudes.\n\n2. **Mapping**: Once the coordinates are obtained, the next step involves mapping. There are several libraries and tools available for this purpose. In Python, one could use Folium or GeoPandas in conjunction with Matplotlib or Plotly for creating interactive maps. These tools allow for the overlay of data points on top of map tiles sourced from various providers (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Google Maps).\n\n3. **Visualization**: For the visualization aspect, each sensor&#x27;s location would be marked on the map, possibly with markers whose size and/or color intensity reflect the average median PM2.5 values. This provides an intuitive visual representation of air quality across different parts of Milan, highlighting areas of concern.\n\nGiven the constraints of our current environment, I&#x27;m unable to directly implement this process. However, the methodology described is robust and adaptable to various scenarios, allowing for detailed environmental analysis and spatial data representation. It&#x27;s worth noting that the precision of geocoding and the effectiveness of the visualization can vary based on the quality of the input data (in this case, the textual addresses) and the chosen tools&#x27; capabilities.\n\nIn practice, such analyses play a crucial role in environmental science, urban planning, and public health, providing insights into air quality patterns that can inform policy decisions and public awareness initiatives. As the technology and methodologies continue to evolve, the integration of more sophisticated machine learning models and big data analytics will further enhance our ability to understand and visualize complex environmental datasets."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "request_id": "86186a457a7b8ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "children": []}, "03e82b03-d886-4ca3-823b-3e556c21a2e3": {"id": "03e82b03-d886-4ca3-823b-3e556c21a2e3", "message": {"id": "03e82b03-d886-4ca3-823b-3e556c21a2e3", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709959546.877304, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To plot the average median PM2.5 values on a map using the address names of the sensors, we&#x27;d typically geocode these addresses to obtain their geographic coordinates. Once we have the coordinates, we could plot them on a map alongside the PM2.5 values.\n\nHowever, direct geocoding and map plotting capabilities are limited in this environment. I can guide you through the process you would follow to achieve this using external tools or software:\n\n1. **Geocode the Sensor Locations**:\n   - Use a geocoding service (e.g., Google Maps Geocoding API, OpenStreetMap&#x27;s Nominatim) to convert the sensor addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates.\n   - Example sensor locations based on the filenames:\n     - Via Santa Marta, Milan, Italy\n     - Oggiaro, Milan, Italy\n     - Corso 22 Marzo, Milan, Italy\n     - Piazzale Libia, Milan, Italy\n\n2. **Prepare the Data**:\n   - Create a dataset that includes the sensor name, its geographic coordinates, and the average median PM2.5 value for 2020.\n\n3. **Plot on a Map**:\n   - Use mapping software or a library (e.g., Leaflet for web, Python&#x27;s Folium or Plotly for scripting) to create a map of Milan.\n   - Plot each sensor&#x27;s location on the map using its coordinates, perhaps using markers or circles.\n   - The size or color of the markers could represent the average median PM2.5 values, providing a visual indication of air quality at each location.\n\nIf you&#x27;re familiar with Python, here&#x27;s a brief outline of how you might script this using `geopy` for geocoding and `folium` for mapping:\n\n```python\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\nimport folium\n\n# Example sensor location\nlocation_name = &quot;Via Santa Marta, Milan, Italy&quot;\ngeolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=&quot;geoapiExercises&quot;)\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(location_name)\n\n# Example map plotting\nm = folium.Map(location=[location.latitude, location.longitude], zoom_start=13)\nfolium.CircleMarker(\n    [location.latitude, location.longitude],\n    radius=5,  # Could adjust based on PM2.5 value\n    popup=&#x27;Average Median PM2.5: X&#x27;,\n    color=&#x27;red&#x27;,\n    fill=True,\n    fill_color=&#x27;red&#x27;\n).add_to(m)\n\nm\n```\n\nThis script is a simple demonstration and would need to be adapted based on your actual data and requirements. You would loop through your dataset to plot each sensor location.\n\nIf you&#x27;re interested in pursuing this further with specific tools or platforms, let me know, and I can provide more tailored advice!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "request_id": "86186a457a7b8ac6-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa25372-cd3e-4ae7-96b9-f8246b5f98c7", "children": ["aaa2b643-5272-42bf-a7b2-9a1d81b2c720"]}, "aaa2b643-5272-42bf-a7b2-9a1d81b2c720": {"id": "aaa2b643-5272-42bf-a7b2-9a1d81b2c720", "message": {"id": "aaa2b643-5272-42bf-a7b2-9a1d81b2c720", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709960191.097274, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["these are the coordinates; Piazzale Libia\n45.454005, 9.209494\n\nCorso Ventidue Marzo, 22\n45.462082, 9.210209\n\nOggiaro\n45.485895, 9.190435\n\nvia santa marta\n45.462231, 9.183522"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "86187a987b0f8ab9-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "03e82b03-d886-4ca3-823b-3e556c21a2e3", "children": ["ca13c947-1af4-4fb4-818f-173eaabb477e"]}, "ca13c947-1af4-4fb4-818f-173eaabb477e": {"id": "ca13c947-1af4-4fb4-818f-173eaabb477e", "message": {"id": "ca13c947-1af4-4fb4-818f-173eaabb477e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709960220.734213, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{\n  &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;Create a map of Milan, Italy, with markers indicating four specific locations, each with a unique color.

When you run it for the first time, it will prompt you to authenticate.\n3. **Authenticate**: Follow the instructions in the terminal to authenticate. This involves visiting a URL, signing in with your Google account, copying the authentication code provided, and pasting it back into the terminal.\n4. **View the Map**: After the script runs, it will save the map as an HTML file named &#x27;milan_map.html&#x27;. Open this file with a web browser to view the satellite image.\n\nThis process ensures that you&#x27;re authenticated and able to access Google Earth Engine resources. Remember, the authentication step only needs to be done once per machine, as the credentials will be stored for future sessions."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa23021-d2f2-40b6-9c0d-f1700f6d8f19", "request_id": "85aac6b0d9a132b0-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa23021-d2f2-40b6-9c0d-f1700f6d8f19", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "030d0650-ec7a-428b-afcf-e8ac4223b629", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "b8d4f26b-ea3e-49c8-b57a-3c4246bb2597", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "id": "b8d4f26b-ea3e-49c8-b57a-3c4246bb2597"}, {"title": "Models EU Act Overview", "create_time": 1708808336.342103, "update_time": 1708810277.899218, "mapping": {"9d5bd662-9287-4301-be2a-a8bd455f40ef": {"id": "9d5bd662-9287-4301-be2a-a8bd455f40ef", "message": {"id": "9d5bd662-9287-4301-be2a-a8bd455f40ef", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa18edf-4802-47c5-85da-a7b5bcd0bc34", "children": ["aaa27660-a8eb-4ff3-937e-e5e8cb183ec5"]}, "aaa18edf-4802-47c5-85da-a7b5bcd0bc34": {"id": "aaa18edf-4802-47c5-85da-a7b5bcd0bc34", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["9d5bd662-9287-4301-be2a-a8bd455f40ef"]}, "aaa27660-a8eb-4ff3-937e-e5e8cb183ec5": {"id": "aaa27660-a8eb-4ff3-937e-e5e8cb183ec5", "message": {"id": "aaa27660-a8eb-4ff3-937e-e5e8cb183ec5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708808336.343406, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["site google earth engine in this style; https://www.ml6.eu/resources/foundation-models.\n[15] Everyday Series.

This has dropped slightly according to \u301050\u2020Milans 2017 estimates\u2020mediagallery.comune.milano.it\u3011. The larger urban area boasts a population of over 3 million, while the metropolitan area has an estimated population of 7 to 10 million.\n\n\u301051\u2020According to Istat information in 2011,\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 over 200,000 residents within the city limits are foreigners. The city is no stranger to influxes of immigrants, having seen over 400,000 people arrive throughout the 1950s through 1970s and experiencing additional immigrant growth during the late 1980s through the 1990s. Much of the immigration has been attributed to the rapid industrialization and public works of the city.\n\nMilan has the largest community of Chinese in the country, with approximately 21,000 Chinese residents last recorded in 2011. There are also a growing number of Filipinos and Sri Lankans migrating to Milan, with 2014 estimates putting their numbers at 42,236 and 16,023, respectively. Other immigrants include those coming from \u301052\u2020Africa\u3011, \u301053\u2020Eastern Europe\u3011 and \u301054\u2020Latin America\u3011.\n\nThe population of Milan is primarily Catholic, although there are also large communities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Protestants. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan and has its own rites \u2013 the Ambrosian Rite \u2013 that differs from traditional Catholicism.\n\nThe city has seen population declines over the last few decades, most recently due to the financial crisis of the 1990s and declines in industries including textiles and steel production. However, \u301055\u2020the last official census taken in 2013\u2020allegati.comune.milano.it\u3011 showed that there was a population increase of 7% compared to the last census, indicating that Milan was rebounding from these past issues.\n\n## Milan History\n\nThe history of the settlement of Milan dates back to \u301056\u2020600 BC.\u2020www.britannica.com\u3011 Early settlement of the area was founded by the Gauls, a Celtic group. During the emperor Augustus\u2019 reign, the already powerful city began gaining increasing power and prestige before becoming a part of the Western Roman Empire. The city was attacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and again in 539 by the Goths, but by the second half of the 10th century, the area had bounced back from the attacks.\n\nOver the next thousands of years, Milan faced multiple conflicts and power struggles but always remained or regained its power as one of the world\u2019s most powerful cities. Rapid industrialization throughout the 1800s and 1900s led to population growth and the city\u2019s role as Italy\u2019s leading financial center. The post-war economic boom led to the construction of skyscrapers and an increase in market capitalization in the stock exchange. The city has not been without controversy and hard times, however, as street violence and terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s and a financial crisis in the 1990s plagued the city.\n\nIn the 1980s, fashion powerhouses including Versace and Armani led to Milan becoming one of the fashion capitals of the world, and Milan Fashion Week continues to be one of the most exciting and anticipated events in the world of fashion. In the late 21st century, Milan has undergone redevelopments including the construction of new business districts and development of revenue sources including tourism, logistics, transport, fashion design, finance and banking, to name a few.\n\n## Milan Population Growth\n\nMilan has been plagued with decades of a declining population, in part due to the \u301057\u2020financial crisis\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and \u301058\u2020industry declines\u2020www.bbc.com\u3011. However, the city is showing slow signs of growth, with city limits of 1.7 million matching the record-high from years ago. The urban population is expected to see slow but progressive growth over the years, with a 2020 estimated population of 3.124 million and a population of 3.16 million in 2030.\n\nCountry\n\n\u301049\u2020Italy\u3011\n\nGrowth Rate \n\n0.19%\n\n## Milan Population 2024 \n\nShow Sources\n\nCSV JSON \n\n### Download Table Data\n\nI agree to receive email from World Population Review \n\nEnter your email below, and you&#x27;ll receive this table&#x27;s data in your inbox momentarily.\n\nSend \n\nX \n\nYear \n\nPopulation \n\nGrowth Rate \n\nGrowth   \n\n1950 1,883,420  \n1951 1,900,576 0.91%17,156   \n1952 1,939,795 2.06%39,219   \n1953 1,991,529 2.67%51,734   \n1954 2,044,718 2.67%53,189   \n1955 2,099,327 2.67%54,609   \n1956 2,155,472 2.67%56,145   \n1957 2,212,959 2.67%57,487   \n1958 2,272,061 2.67%59,102   \n1959 2,332,742 2.67%60,681   \n1960 2,395,130 2.67%62,388   \n1961 2,459,009 2.67%63,879   \n1962 2,517,959 2.4%58,950   \n1963 2,575,509 2.29%57,550   \n1964 2,634,457 2.29%58,948   \n1965 2,694,587 2.28%60,130   \n1966 2,756,175 2.29%61,588   \n1967 2,819,170 2.29%62,995   \n1968 2,883,695 2.29%64,525   \n1969 2,949,513 2.28%65,818   \n1970 3,016,927 2.29%67,414   \n1971 3,085,883 2.29%68,956   \n1972 3,112,652 0.87%26,769   \n1973 3,119,532 0.22%6,880   \n1974 3,126,436 0.22%6,904   \n1975 3,133,356 0.22%6,920   \n1976 3,140,301 0.22%6,945   \n1977 3,147,242 0.22%6,941   \n1978 3,154,207 0.22%6,965   \n1979 3,161,189 0.22%6,982   \n1980 3,168,195 0.22%7,006   \n1981 3,175,197 0.22%7,002   \n1982 3,168,277-0.22%-6,920   \n1983 3,154,909-0.42%-13,368   \n1984 3,141,580-0.42%-13,329   \n1985 3,128,343-0.42%-13,237   \n1986 3,115,143-0.42%-13,200   \n1987 3,102,000-0.42%-13,143   \n1988 3,088,893-0.42%-13,107   \n1989 3,075,878-0.42%-13,015   \n1990 3,062,900-0.42%-12,978   \n1991 3,049,977-0.42%-12,923   \n1992 3,041,104-0.29%-8,873   \n1993 3,034,023-0.23%-7,081   \n1994 3,026,948-0.23%-7,075   \n1995 3,019,890-0.23%-7,058   \n1996 3,012,839-0.23%-7,051   \n1997 3,005,823-0.23%-7,016   \n1998 2,998,815-0.23%-7,008   \n1999 2,991,822-0.23%-6,993   \n2000 2,984,837-0.23%-6,985   \n2001 2,977,886-0.23%-6,951   \n2002 2,982,083 0.14%4,197   \n2003 2,991,237 0.31%9,154   \n2004 3,000,432 0.31%9,195   \n2005 3,009,629 0.31%9,197   \n2006 3,018,868 0.31%9,239   \n2007 3,028,135 0.31%9,267   \n2008 3,037,443 0.31%9,308   \n2009 3,046,754 0.31%9,311   \n2010 3,056,107", "title": "Milan Population 2024"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og", "regex": "\u3010(\\d+)(?::(\\d+))?\u2020([^\u2020\u3010\u3011]*)[^\u3010\u3011]*?\u3011"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "Milan Population 2024", "url": "https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/milan-population", "text": "\n## Milan Demographics\n\nIndustrialization during the post-war years led to a population boom that put the Milan city population at a record high of 1,743,427 in 1973, a number that was matched in 2016.

Other immigrants include those coming from \u301052\u2020Africa\u3011, \u301053\u2020Eastern Europe\u3011 and \u301054\u2020Latin America\u3011.\n\nThe population of Milan is primarily Catholic, although there are also large communities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Protestants. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan and has its own rites \u2013 the Ambrosian Rite \u2013 that differs from traditional Catholicism.\n\nThe city has seen population declines over the last few decades, most recently due to the financial crisis of the 1990s and declines in industries including textiles and steel production. However, \u301055\u2020the last official census taken in 2013\u2020allegati.comune.milano.it\u3011 showed that there was a population increase of 7% compared to the last census, indicating that Milan was rebounding from these past issues.\n\n## Milan History\n\nThe history of the settlement of Milan dates back to \u301056\u2020600 BC.\u2020www.britannica.com\u3011 Early settlement of the area was founded by the Gauls, a Celtic group. During the emperor Augustus\u2019 reign, the already powerful city began gaining increasing power and prestige before becoming a part of the Western Roman Empire. The city was attacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and again in 539 by the Goths, but by the second half of the 10th century, the area had bounced back from the attacks.\n\nOver the next thousands of years, Milan faced multiple conflicts and power struggles but always remained or regained its power as one of the world\u2019s most powerful cities. Rapid industrialization throughout the 1800s and 1900s led to population growth and the city\u2019s role as Italy\u2019s leading financial center. The post-war economic boom led to the construction of skyscrapers and an increase in market capitalization in the stock exchange. The city has not been without controversy and hard times, however, as street violence and terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s and a financial crisis in the 1990s plagued the city.\n\nIn the 1980s, fashion powerhouses including Versace and Armani led to Milan becoming one of the fashion capitals of the world, and Milan Fashion Week continues to be one of the most exciting and anticipated events in the world of fashion. In the late 21st century, Milan has undergone redevelopments including the construction of new business districts and development of revenue sources including tourism, logistics, transport, fashion design, finance and banking, to name a few.\n\n## Milan Population Growth\n\nMilan has been plagued with decades of a declining population, in part due to the \u301057\u2020financial crisis\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and \u301058\u2020industry declines\u2020www.bbc.com\u3011. However, the city is showing slow signs of growth, with city limits of 1.7 million matching the record-high from years ago. The urban population is expected to see slow but progressive growth over the years, with a 2020 estimated population of 3.124 million and a population of 3.16 million in 2030.\n\nCountry\n\n\u301049\u2020Italy\u3011\n\nGrowth Rate \n\n0.19%\n\n## Milan Population 2024 \n\nShow Sources\n\nCSV JSON \n\n### Download Table Data\n\nI agree to receive email from World

The fluctuations in Milan&#x27;s population can be attributed to various factors, including industrialization, economic crises, and migration patterns.

This has dropped slightly according to \u301050\u2020Milans 2017 estimates\u2020mediagallery.comune.milano.it\u3011. The larger urban area boasts a population of over 3 million, while the metropolitan area has an estimated population of 7 to 10 million.\n\n\u301051\u2020According to Istat information in 2011,\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 over 200,000 residents within the city limits are foreigners. The city is no stranger to influxes of immigrants, having seen over 400,000 people arrive throughout the 1950s through 1970s and experiencing additional immigrant growth during the late 1980s through the 1990s. Much of the immigration has been attributed to the rapid industrialization and public works of the city.\n\nMilan has the largest community of Chinese in the country, with approximately 21,000 Chinese residents last recorded in 2011. There are also a growing number of Filipinos and Sri Lankans migrating to Milan, with 2014 estimates putting their numbers at 42,236 and 16,023, respectively. Other immigrants include those coming from \u301052\u2020Africa\u3011, \u301053\u2020Eastern Europe\u3011 and \u301054\u2020Latin America\u3011.\n\nThe population of Milan is primarily Catholic, although there are also large communities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Protestants. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan and has its own rites \u2013 the Ambrosian Rite \u2013 that differs from traditional Catholicism.\n\nThe city has seen population declines over the last few decades, most recently due to the financial crisis of the 1990s and declines in industries including textiles and steel production. However, \u301055\u2020the last official census taken in 2013\u2020allegati.comune.milano.it\u3011 showed that there was a population increase of 7% compared to the last census, indicating that Milan was rebounding from these past issues.\n\n## Milan History\n\nThe history of the settlement of Milan dates back to \u301056\u2020600 BC.\u2020www.britannica.com\u3011 Early settlement of the area was founded by the Gauls, a Celtic group. During the emperor Augustus\u2019 reign, the already powerful city began gaining increasing power and prestige before becoming a part of the Western Roman Empire. The city was attacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and again in 539 by the Goths, but by the second half of the 10th century, the area had bounced back from the attacks.\n\nOver the next thousands of years, Milan faced multiple conflicts and power struggles but always remained or regained its power as one of the world\u2019s most powerful cities. Rapid industrialization throughout the 1800s and 1900s led to population growth and the city\u2019s role as Italy\u2019s leading financial center. The post-war economic boom led to the construction of skyscrapers and an increase in market capitalization in the stock exchange. The city has not been without controversy and hard times, however, as street violence and terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s and a financial crisis in the 1990s plagued the city.\n\nIn the 1980s, fashion powerhouses including Versace and Armani led to Milan becoming one of the fashion capitals of the world, and Milan Fashion Week continues to be one of the most exciting and anticipated events in the world of fashion. In the late 21st century, Milan has undergone redevelopments including the construction of new business districts and development of revenue sources including tourism, logistics, transport, fashion design, finance and banking, to name a few.\n\n## Milan Population Growth\n\nMilan has been plagued with decades of a declining population, in part due to the \u301057\u2020financial crisis\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and \u301058\u2020industry declines\u2020www.bbc.com\u3011. However, the city is showing slow signs of growth, with city limits of 1.7 million matching the record-high from years ago. The urban population is expected to see slow but progressive growth over the years, with a 2020 estimated population of 3.124 million and a population of 3.16 million in 2030.\n\nCountry\n\n\u301049\u2020Italy\u3011\n\nGrowth Rate \n\n0.19%\n\n## Milan Population 2024 \n\nShow Sources\n\nCSV JSON \n\n### Download Table Data\n\nI agree to receive email from World

These databases might allow for a more detailed analysis and provide the specific average annual temperature in Milan over the last 50 years."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [{"start_ix": 942, "end_ix": 953, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Climate &amp; Weather Averages in Milan, Italy", "url": "https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/italy/milan/climate", "text": "    * \u301036\u2020Local Weather\u3011\n    * \u301037\u2020Hour-by-Hour\u3011\n    * \u301038\u20202-Week Forecast\u3011\n    * \u301039\u2020Past Week\u3011\n    * \u301040\u2020Climate\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Sun, Moon &amp; Space\u3011\n    * \u301042\u2020Sun &amp; Moon Home\u3011\n    * \u301043\u2020Sun Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301044\u2020Moon Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301045\u2020Moon Phases\u3011\n    * \u301046\u2020Night Sky\u3011\n    * \u301047\u2020Meteor Showers\u3011\n    * \u301048\u2020Day and Night Map\u3011\n    * \u301049\u2020Moon Light World Map\u3011\n    * \u301050\u2020Eclipses\u3011\n    * \u301051\u2020April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020Live Streams\u3011\n    * \u301052\u2020Seasons\u3011\n    * \u30102\u2020Astronomy News\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Timers\u3011\n    * \u301054\u2020Timers Home\u3011\n    * \u301055\u2020Stopwatch\u3011\n    * \u301056\u2020Timer\u3011\n    * \u301057\u2020Countdown to Any Date\u3011\n    * \u301058\u2020Spring Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301059\u2020Easter Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301060\u2020New Year Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301061\u2020Countdown for Your Site\u3011\n  * \u301062\u2020Calculators\u3011\n    * \u301062\u2020Calculators Home\u3011\n    * \u301063\u2020Date to Date Calculator (duration)\u3011\n    * \u301064\u2020Business Date to Date (exclude holidays)\u3011\n    * \u301065\u2020Date Calculator (add / subtract)\u3011\n    * \u301066\u2020Business Date (exclude holidays)\u3011\n    * \u301067\u2020Weekday Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301068\u2020Week Number Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301069\u2020Roman Numeral Converter\u3011\n    * \u301070\u2020Alternative Age Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301071\u2020Date Pattern Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301072\u2020Distance Calculator\u3011\n  * \u301073\u2020 My Account\u3011\n    * \u301074\u2020My Account\u3011\n    * \u301075\u2020My Location\u3011\n    * \u301076\u2020My Units\u3011\n    * \u301027\u2020My Events\u3011\n    * \u30109\u2020My World Clock\u3011\n    * \u301077\u2020My Privacy\u3011\n    * \u301078\u2020Paid Services\u3011\n    * \u301079\u2020Sign in\u3011\n    * \u301080\u2020Register\u3011\n\n\u301081\u2020Home\u3011 \u00a0 \u301035\u2020Weather\u3011 \u00a0 \u301082\u2020Italy\u3011 \u00a0 \u301083\u2020Milan\u3011 \u00a0 Climate\n\n[Image 1: Flag for Italy] \n\n# Climate &amp; Weather Averages in Milan, Italy\n\n  * \u301084\u2020Time/General\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Weather \u3011\n    * \u301083\u2020Weather Today/Tomorrow \u3011\n    * \u301085\u2020Hour-by-Hour Forecast \u3011\n    * \u301086\u202014 Day Forecast \u3011\n    *     * \u301087\u2020Yesterday/Past Weather\u3011\n    * \u301088\u2020Climate (Averages)\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Time Zone \u3011\n  * \u301090\u2020DST Changes\u3011\n  * \u301091\u2020Sun &amp; Moon \u3011\n    * \u301091\u2020Sun &amp; Moon Today \u3011\n    * \u301092\u2020Sunrise &amp; Sunset \u3011\n    *     * \u301093\u2020Moonrise &amp; Moonset \u3011\n    * \u301094\u2020Moon Phases \u3011\n    *     * \u301095\u2020Eclipses \u3011\n    * \u301096\u2020Night Sky \u3011\n\n\u301083\u2020Weather Today\u3011\u301085\u2020Weather Hourly\u3011\u301086\u202014 Day Forecast\u3011\u301087\u2020Yesterday/Past Weather\u3011\u301088\u2020Climate (Averages)\u3011\n\n[Image 2]Currently: 50\u00a0\u00b0F.

The sources provided general climate averages and conditions for Milan, such as average high and low temperatures throughout the year, precipitation, and other weather statistics, but they don&#x27;t offer a straightforward yearly breakdown that would allow for a simple extraction of the last ten years&#x27; temperature distribution.\n\nHowever, to understand the temperature distribution in Milan, one could consider the city&#x27;s general climate characteristics as indicated by the averages. Milan experiences a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and cold, foggy winters. The mean temperature throughout the year tends to be around 58\u00b0F (14.4\u00b0C), with variations that reflect seasonal changes. The highest average temperatures are observed in July, around 87\u00b0F (30.6\u00b0C), and the lowest in January, around 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C)\u301034\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor a detailed temperature distribution over the last ten years, one would typically review historical weather data from meteorological services or databases like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset (ECA&amp;D), or other relevant climate databases. These platforms could provide annual and monthly temperature averages, extremes, and other relevant statistics that detail the temperature distribution over the desired period.\n\nFor individuals or researchers interested in this data, I recommend consulting such databases or contacting local meteorological services for access to comprehensive, year-by-year climate data for Milan. This approach would offer the most accurate representation of the city&#x27;s temperature distribution over the last decade."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [{"start_ix": 1020, "end_ix": 1031, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Climate &amp; Weather Averages in Milan, Italy", "url": "https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/italy/milan/climate", "text": "    * \u301036\u2020Local Weather\u3011\n    * \u301037\u2020Hour-by-Hour\u3011\n    * \u301038\u20202-Week Forecast\u3011\n    * \u301039\u2020Past Week\u3011\n    * \u301040\u2020Climate\u3011\n  * \u301041\u2020Sun, Moon &amp; Space\u3011\n    * \u301042\u2020Sun &amp; Moon Home\u3011\n    * \u301043\u2020Sun Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301044\u2020Moon Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301045\u2020Moon Phases\u3011\n    * \u301046\u2020Night Sky\u3011\n    * \u301047\u2020Meteor Showers\u3011\n    * \u301048\u2020Day and Night Map\u3011\n    * \u301049\u2020Moon Light World Map\u3011\n    * \u301050\u2020Eclipses\u3011\n    * \u301051\u2020April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\u3011\n    * \u30106\u2020Live Streams\u3011\n    * \u301052\u2020Seasons\u3011\n    * \u30102\u2020Astronomy News\u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020Timers\u3011\n    * \u301054\u2020Timers Home\u3011\n    * \u301055\u2020Stopwatch\u3011\n    * \u301056\u2020Timer\u3011\n    * \u301057\u2020Countdown to Any Date\u3011\n    * \u301058\u2020Spring Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301059\u2020Easter Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301060\u2020New Year Countdown\u3011\n    * \u301061\u2020Countdown for Your Site\u3011\n  * \u301062\u2020Calculators\u3011\n    * \u301062\u2020Calculators Home\u3011\n    * \u301063\u2020Date to Date Calculator (duration)\u3011\n    * \u301064\u2020Business Date to Date (exclude holidays)\u3011\n    * \u301065\u2020Date Calculator (add / subtract)\u3011\n    * \u301066\u2020Business Date (exclude holidays)\u3011\n    * \u301067\u2020Weekday Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301068\u2020Week Number Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301069\u2020Roman Numeral Converter\u3011\n    * \u301070\u2020Alternative Age Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301071\u2020Date Pattern Calculator\u3011\n    * \u301072\u2020Distance Calculator\u3011\n  * \u301073\u2020 My Account\u3011\n    * \u301074\u2020My Account\u3011\n    * \u301075\u2020My Location\u3011\n    * \u301076\u2020My Units\u3011\n    * \u301027\u2020My Events\u3011\n    * \u30109\u2020My World Clock\u3011\n    * \u301077\u2020My Privacy\u3011\n    * \u301078\u2020Paid Services\u3011\n    * \u301079\u2020Sign in\u3011\n    * \u301080\u2020Register\u3011\n\n\u301081\u2020Home\u3011 \u00a0 \u301035\u2020Weather\u3011 \u00a0 \u301082\u2020Italy\u3011 \u00a0 \u301083\u2020Milan\u3011 \u00a0 Climate\n\n[Image 1: Flag for Italy] \n\n# Climate &amp; Weather Averages in Milan, Italy\n\n  * \u301084\u2020Time/General\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Weather \u3011\n    * \u301083\u2020Weather Today/Tomorrow \u3011\n    * \u301085\u2020Hour-by-Hour Forecast \u3011\n    * \u301086\u202014 Day Forecast \u3011\n    *     * \u301087\u2020Yesterday/Past Weather\u3011\n    * \u301088\u2020Climate (Averages)\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Time Zone \u3011\n  * \u301090\u2020DST Changes\u3011\n  * \u301091\u2020Sun &amp; Moon \u3011\n    * \u301091\u2020Sun &amp; Moon Today \u3011\n    * \u301092\u2020Sunrise &amp; Sunset \u3011\n    *     * \u301093\u2020Moonrise &amp; Moonset \u3011\n    * \u301094\u2020Moon Phases \u3011\n    *     * \u301095\u2020Eclipses \u3011\n    * \u301096\u2020Night Sky \u3011\n\n\u301083\u2020Weather Today\u3011\u301085\u2020Weather Hourly\u3011\u301086\u202014 Day Forecast\u3011\u301087\u2020Yesterday/Past Weather\u3011\u301088\u2020Climate (Averages)\u3011\n\n[Image 2]Currently: 50\u00a0\u00b0F.

This has dropped slightly according to \u301050\u2020Milans 2017 estimates\u2020mediagallery.comune.milano.it\u3011. The larger urban area boasts a population of over 3 million, while the metropolitan area has an estimated population of 7 to 10 million.\n\n\u301051\u2020According to Istat information in 2011,\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 over 200,000 residents within the city limits are foreigners. The city is no stranger to influxes of immigrants, having seen over 400,000 people arrive throughout the 1950s through 1970s and experiencing additional immigrant growth during the late 1980s through the 1990s. Much of the immigration has been attributed to the rapid industrialization and public works of the city.\n\nMilan has the largest community of Chinese in the country, with approximately 21,000 Chinese residents last recorded in 2011. There are also a growing number of Filipinos and Sri Lankans migrating to Milan, with 2014 estimates putting their numbers at 42,236 and 16,023, respectively. Other immigrants include those coming from \u301052\u2020Africa\u3011, \u301053\u2020Eastern Europe\u3011 and \u301054\u2020Latin America\u3011.\n\nThe population of Milan is primarily Catholic, although there are also large communities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Protestants. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan and has its own rites \u2013 the Ambrosian Rite \u2013 that differs from traditional Catholicism.\n\nThe city has seen population declines over the last few decades, most recently due to the financial crisis of the 1990s and declines in industries including textiles and steel production. However, \u301055\u2020the last official census taken in 2013\u2020allegati.comune.milano.it\u3011 showed that there was a population increase of 7% compared to the last census, indicating that Milan was rebounding from these past issues.\n\n## Milan History\n\nThe history of the settlement of Milan dates back to \u301056\u2020600 BC.\u2020www.britannica.com\u3011 Early settlement of the area was founded by the Gauls, a Celtic group. During the emperor Augustus\u2019 reign, the already powerful city began gaining increasing power and prestige before becoming a part of the Western Roman Empire. The city was attacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and again in 539 by the Goths, but by the second half of the 10th century, the area had bounced back from the attacks.\n\nOver the next thousands of years, Milan faced multiple conflicts and power struggles but always remained or regained its power as one of the world\u2019s most powerful cities. Rapid industrialization throughout the 1800s and 1900s led to population growth and the city\u2019s role as Italy\u2019s leading financial center. The post-war economic boom led to the construction of skyscrapers and an increase in market capitalization in the stock exchange. The city has not been without controversy and hard times, however, as street violence and terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s and a financial crisis in the 1990s plagued the city.\n\nIn the 1980s, fashion powerhouses including Versace and Armani led to Milan becoming one of the fashion capitals of the world, and Milan Fashion Week continues to be one of the most exciting and anticipated events in the world of fashion. In the late 21st century, Milan has undergone redevelopments including the construction of new business districts and development of revenue sources including tourism, logistics, transport, fashion design, finance and banking, to name a few.\n\n## Milan Population Growth\n\nMilan has been plagued with decades of a declining population, in part due to the \u301057\u2020financial crisis\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and \u301058\u2020industry declines\u2020www.bbc.com\u3011. However, the city is showing slow signs of growth, with city limits of 1.7 million matching the record-high from years ago. The urban population is expected to see slow but progressive growth over the years, with a 2020 estimated population of 3.124 million and a population of 3.16 million in 2030.\n\nCountry\n\n\u301049\u2020Italy\u3011\n\nGrowth Rate \n\n0.19%\n\n## Milan Population 2024 \n\nShow Sources\n\nCSV JSON \n\n### Download Table Data\n\nI agree to receive email from World Population Review \n\nEnter your email below, and you&#x27;ll receive this table&#x27;s data in your inbox momentarily.\n\nSend \n\nX \n\nYear \n\nPopulation \n\nGrowth Rate \n\nGrowth   \n\n1950 1,883,420  \n1951 1,900,576 0.91%17,156   \n1952 1,939,795 2.06%39,219   \n1953 1,991,529 2.67%51,734   \n1954 2,044,718 2.67%53,189   \n1955 2,099,327 2.67%54,609   \n1956 2,155,472 2.67%56,145   \n1957 2,212,959 2.67%57,487   \n1958 2,272,061 2.67%59,102   \n1959 2,332,742 2.67%60,681   \n1960 2,395,130 2.67%62,388   \n1961 2,459,009 2.67%63,879   \n1962 2,517,959 2.4%58,950   \n1963 2,575,509 2.29%57,550   \n1964 2,634,457 2.29%58,948   \n1965 2,694,587 2.28%60,130   \n1966 2,756,175 2.29%61,588   \n1967 2,819,170 2.29%62,995   \n1968 2,883,695 2.29%64,525   \n1969 2,949,513 2.28%65,818   \n1970 3,016,927 2.29%67,414   \n1971 3,085,883 2.29%68,956   \n1972 3,112,652 0.87%26,769   \n1973 3,119,532 0.22%6,880   \n1974 3,126,436 0.22%6,904   \n1975 3,133,356 0.22%6,920   \n1976 3,140,301 0.22%6,945   \n1977 3,147,242 0.22%6,941   \n1978 3,154,207 0.22%6,965   \n1979 3,161,189 0.22%6,982   \n1980 3,168,195 0.22%7,006   \n1981 3,175,197 0.22%7,002   \n1982 3,168,277-0.22%-6,920   \n1983 3,154,909-0.42%-13,368   \n1984 3,141,580-0.42%-13,329   \n1985 3,128,343-0.42%-13,237   \n1986 3,115,143-0.42%-13,200   \n1987 3,102,000-0.42%-13,143   \n1988 3,088,893-0.42%-13,107   \n1989 3,075,878-0.42%-13,015   \n1990 3,062,900-0.42%-12,978   \n1991 3,049,977-0.42%-12,923   \n1992 3,041,104-0.29%-8,873   \n1993 3,034,023-0.23%-7,081   \n1994 3,026,948-0.23%-7,075   \n1995 3,019,890-0.23%-7,058   \n1996 3,012,839-0.23%-7,051   \n1997 3,005,823-0.23%-7,016   \n1998 2,998,815-0.23%-7,008   \n1999 2,991,822-0.23%-6,993   \n2000 2,984,837-0.23%-6,985   \n2001 2,977,886-0.23%-6,951   \n2002 2,982,083 0.14%4,197   \n2003 2,991,237 0.31%9,154   \n2004 3,000,432 0.31%9,195   \n2005 3,009,629 0.31%9,197   \n2006 3,018,868 0.31%9,239   \n2007 3,028,135 0.31%9,267   \n2008 3,037,443 0.31%9,308   \n2009 3,046,754 0.31%9,311   \n2010 3,056,107", "title": "Milan Population 2024"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og", "regex": "\u3010(\\d+)(?::(\\d+))?\u2020([^\u2020\u3010\u3011]*)[^\u3010\u3011]*?\u3011"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "Milan Population 2024", "url": "https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/milan-population", "text": "\n## Milan Demographics\n\nIndustrialization during the post-war years led to a population boom that put the Milan city population at a record high of 1,743,427 in 1973, a number that was matched in 2016.

Here&#x27;s a summary of the estimated population numbers for Milan during these years:\n\n- **2019**: Approximately 3,136,000 people\n- **2020**: Approximately 3,140,000 people\n- **2021**: Approximately 3,144,000 people\n- **2022**: Approximately 3,149,000 people\n- **2023**: Approximately 3,155,000 people\n\nThese figures indicate a gradual increase in Milan&#x27;s population over the last few years. The population growth is reflective of Milan&#x27;s status as a major metropolitan area in Italy, with a wide array of attractions including economic opportunities, cultural sites, and educational institutions that continue to draw people to the city.\n\nFor detailed population statistics and demographic information about Milan, you can refer to Population Stat\u301045\u2020source\u3011 and City Population\u301046\u2020source\u3011."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [{"start_ix": 834, "end_ix": 845, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Milan Population 2024", "url": "https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/milan-population", "text": "\n## Milan Demographics\n\nIndustrialization during the post-war years led to a population boom that put the Milan city population at a record high of 1,743,427 in 1973, a number that was matched in 2016. This has dropped slightly according to \u301050\u2020Milans 2017 estimates\u2020mediagallery.comune.milano.it\u3011. The larger urban area boasts a population of over 3 million, while the metropolitan area has an estimated population of 7 to 10 million.\n\n\u301051\u2020According to Istat information in 2011,\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 over 200,000 residents within the city limits are foreigners. The city is no stranger to influxes of immigrants, having seen over 400,000 people arrive throughout the 1950s through 1970s and experiencing additional immigrant growth during the late 1980s through the 1990s. Much of the immigration has been attributed to the rapid industrialization and public works of the city.\n\nMilan has the largest community of Chinese in the country, with approximately 21,000 Chinese residents last recorded in 2011. There are also a growing number of Filipinos and Sri Lankans migrating to Milan, with 2014 estimates putting their numbers at 42,236 and 16,023, respectively. Other immigrants include those coming from \u301052\u2020Africa\u3011, \u301053\u2020Eastern Europe\u3011 and \u301054\u2020Latin America\u3011.\n\nThe population of Milan is primarily Catholic, although there are also large communities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Protestants. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan and has its own rites \u2013 the Ambrosian Rite \u2013 that differs from traditional Catholicism.\n\nThe city has seen population declines over the last few decades, most recently due to the financial crisis of the 1990s and declines in industries including textiles and steel production. However, \u301055\u2020the last official census taken in 2013\u2020allegati.comune.milano.it\u3011 showed that there was a population increase of 7% compared to the last census, indicating that Milan was rebounding from these past issues.\n\n## Milan History\n\nThe history of the settlement of Milan dates back to \u301056\u2020600 BC.\u2020www.britannica.com\u3011 Early settlement of the area was founded by the Gauls, a Celtic group. During the emperor Augustus\u2019 reign, the already powerful city began gaining increasing power and prestige before becoming a part of the Western Roman Empire. The city was attacked by Attila the Hun in 452 and again in 539 by the Goths, but by the second half of the 10th century, the area had bounced back from the attacks.\n\nOver the next thousands of years, Milan faced multiple conflicts and power struggles but always remained or regained its power as one of the world\u2019s most powerful cities. Rapid industrialization throughout the 1800s and 1900s led to population growth and the city\u2019s role as Italy\u2019s leading financial center. The post-war economic boom led to the construction of skyscrapers and an increase in market capitalization in the stock exchange. The city has not been without controversy and hard times, however, as street violence and terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s and a financial crisis in the 1990s plagued the city.\n\nIn the 1980s, fashion powerhouses including Versace and Armani led to Milan becoming one of the fashion capitals of the world, and Milan Fashion Week continues to be one of the most exciting and anticipated events in the world of fashion. In the late 21st century, Milan has undergone redevelopments including the construction of new business districts and development of revenue sources including tourism, logistics, transport, fashion design, finance and banking, to name a few.\n\n## Milan Population Growth\n\nMilan has been plagued with decades of a declining population, in part due to the \u301057\u2020financial crisis\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and \u301058\u2020industry declines\u2020www.bbc.com\u3011. However, the city is showing slow signs of growth, with city limits of 1.7 million matching the record-high from years ago. The urban population is expected to see slow but progressive growth over the years, with a 2020 estimated population of 3.124 million and a population of 3.16 million in 2030.\n\nCountry\n\n\u301049\u2020Italy\u3011\n\nGrowth Rate \n\n0.19%\n\n## Milan Population 2024 \n\nShow Sources\n\nCSV JSON \n\n### Download Table Data\n\nI agree to receive email from World

the Earth&#x27;s surface. This type of data is essential in various fields such as geography, environmental science, urban planning, logistics, and many more, providing valuable insights into physical locations, shapes, and geographic relationships. Here are some common examples of geospatial data:\n\n1. **Coordinates**: Data points defined by latitude and longitude, used to represent specific locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface.\n\n2. **Maps**: Visual representations of areas, showing physical features, political boundaries, and other attributes. Maps can be either static or dynamic and can represent various levels of detail.\n\n3. **Satellite Imagery**: Images of the Earth taken from satellites, used for a wide range of applications including weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and land use mapping.\n\n4. **Aerial Photography**: High-resolution images taken from aircraft, useful for detailed analysis of land use, urban planning, and environmental studies.\n\n5. **Remote Sensing Data**: Information collected from a distance, typically using satellite or aerial sensors, to obtain information about the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. This can include data on vegetation, land surface temperatures, and ocean colors.\n\n6. **GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Data**: A framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing spatial data. GIS data can include various types of information such as demographics, land use, elevation, and transportation networks.\n\n7. **Census Data**: Demographic information collected by governments, including population density, housing, and socio-economic characteristics, all tied to specific geographic locations.\n\n8. **Climate Data**: Information on climate patterns and weather conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, usually collected over long periods and associated with specific locations.\n\n9. **Topographic Data**: Data that describes the shape and features of the Earth&#x27;s surface, including elevations, mountains, valleys, and bodies of water.\n\n10. **Transportation Networks**: Data on roads, railways, air routes, and shipping lanes, including their locations, lengths, and connectivity.\n\n11. **Infrastructure Data**: Information on the location and characteristics of physical infrastructure such as buildings, utilities, and communication networks.\n\n12. **Land Use and Land Cover Data**: Information on the types of vegetation, urban areas, water bodies, and other land cover types, as well as how land is being used (e.g., agriculture, residential, commercial).\n\n13. **Environmental Monitoring Data**: Data related to environmental conditions and changes, such as pollution levels, forest cover changes, and water quality.\n\n14. **Real-Time Location Data**: Information on the current location of objects or individuals, often collected through GPS devices, used in navigation, tracking, and fleet management.\n\nThese examples showcase the diversity and utility of geospatial data across various domains, highlighting its importance in decision-making, planning, and research activities."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2ebab-c9ed-4f40-b97d-88d5c5e8392b", "request_id": "85a85c721f108aae-AMM", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2ebab-c9ed-4f40-b97d-88d5c5e8392b", "children": ["aaa2b799-e57d-4bfa-9272-0c53a3ea7ee1"]}, "aaa2b799-e57d-4bfa-9272-0c53a3ea7ee1": {"id": "aaa2b799-e57d-4bfa-9272-0c53a3ea7ee1", "message": {"id": "aaa2b799-e57d-4bfa-9272-0c53a3ea7ee1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708785602.59558, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["site this: https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/milan-population; in this style [15] Everyday Series.

It&#x27;s really huge! You would need at least half a day to discover it well!

We enjoyed looking at the ducks and landscaping, but some of the paths were a bit muddy after it had rained the day before.\n\n\u3010106\u2020Elitsa Levendova \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWonderful big park.

It feels very relaxing even if there are many people visiting it. You can bring the kids to the playground, walk your dog, and ride your bicycle. When we visited the weather was very nice and there were many people (alone as well in group) jogging or exercising. It has also many quiet spots where you can just bring your chair and relax. From here you can also enter the Sforzesco Castle and see the Arch of Peace.\n\n\u3010109\u2020Adriana Ruini \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWe walked through Sforzesco Castle grounds and came out at this lovely lush green park area with a lovely pond full of large fish and terrapins.

There are three playgrounds for children, an entertainment space with rides, and bars.\n\nSlide 1 of 9 \n\nI loved the garden. You have so many activities to do there, especially walking-you can walk all day long, it&#x27;s that big. There&#x27;s also the Museum od Natural History and the Planetarium (which you must visit, they have so many interesting events) In conclusion, I recommend you going there and exploring the garden, it&#x27;s definitely worth the visit.\n\n\u3010111\u2020An?ela Jovanovi? \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nQuiet, beautiful and relaxing place!

The garden is huge, with many different trees, green areas to enjoy, jogging paths, children&#x27;s playgrounds, ponds. The garden also houses the Museum of Natural History and the Planetarium.\n\n\u3010113\u2020Goran \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nI really really love this park. It&#x27;s not huge but for Milan it is. It has rolling fields, gorgeous ancient trees, dog parks, a museum, a brook and children playing. It&#x27;s a happy place for me notwithstanding the name they decided to give it. For respect of the harm we did when we were colonialists and for the little girls that were hurt by hard men with no scruples I wish they would change the name but.. this is the world we live in. Beautiful gardens though.\n\n\u3010114\u2020Bianca MM \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nI was very positively surprised to have found this place right in the center of Milan. It&#x27;s amazing how many facilities they have for dogs and it&#x27;s all free! There&#x27;s a large enclosed area with an obstacle course and a water fountain as well as an unenclosed area for dogs with a fresh water pool. I also tried the bar in the park and food was up to part with a restaurant and really well priced!\n\n\u3010115\u2020Matteo Tomassetti \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nCame across the park exploring the city.

It is located towards the west side of the city. It is the lung of Milan. One can idle the time sitting next to a lake which was in the centre of the wooded area. But being within the city the mouse of the loud city traffic does come from time to time. The best spot I liked was sitting on a semicircular bench next to the lake. It was fall season when I visited this place. The grass was green and tree leaves were beautiful colours of yellow, orange , red and brown of different shades. There is a picnic spot and old sheds for barbecue. Good place for spending time with friends and family.\n\n\u3010130\u2020Sanz Barny \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nIts a big park where you can grill on summer days. Must prenotate 1 month before so you can have a place. It\u2019s limited spot. They only have 15 spot to grill and for tables. Time for grilling morning up to afternoon towards 8/9 am up to 4/5 pm I don\u2019t remember exactly . We\u2019ve had a great birthday celebration here. It was pity cause this place must be cure for everything we do but some people leave their trash everywhere. I hope the the government can do something on it.

The park is divided into sections each designed around a unique theme. One is planted with iris, another with poppies. One is a dog park another is a child&#x27;s playground. One has wooden chaise lounges instead of benches. You can walk through most segments and since the segments are odd shapes it is a very pleasant wander.\n\n\u3010141\u2020Richard Rosenbaum \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWhat a great park.

I recently visited this beautiful park and was impressed by its peaceful atmosphere and stunning scenery. The gardens are meticulously maintained, and it&#x27;s clear that the staff takes great pride in keeping the park in top shape. As I strolled through the park, I was struck by the variety of trees and plants on display, from towering palms to fragrant roses. The park also features several beautiful fountains and a lovely pond, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon stroll or picnic. What I appreciated most about Guastalla Gardens is how well-designed the park is. There are plenty of benches and seating areas scattered throughout the park, providing ample space to sit and take in the beautiful surroundings. The park is also very clean, making it a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a peaceful moment. Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Guastalla Gardens for anyone looking for a tranquil and beautiful green space in the heart of Milan. Whether you&#x27;re a local or a tourist, this park is definitely worth a visit.\n\n\u3010145\u2020Lyla \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nBeautiful park well taken care of!

It feels very relaxing even if there are many people visiting it. You can bring the kids to the playground, walk your dog, and ride your bicycle. When we visited the weather was very nice and there were many people (alone as well in group) jogging or exercising. It has also many quiet spots where you can just bring your chair and relax. From here you can also enter the Sforzesco Castle and see the Arch of Peace.\n\n\u3010109\u2020Adriana Ruini \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWe walked through Sforzesco Castle grounds and came out at this lovely lush green park area with a lovely pond full of large fish and terrapins.

It&#x27;s not huge but for Milan it is. It has rolling fields, gorgeous ancient trees, dog parks, a museum, a brook and children playing. It&#x27;s a happy place for me notwithstanding the name they decided to give it. For respect of the harm we did when we were colonialists and for the little girls that were hurt by hard men with no scruples I wish they would change the name but.. this is the world we live in. Beautiful gardens though.\n\n\u3010114\u2020Bianca MM \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nI was very positively surprised to have found this place right in the center of Milan.

It is located towards the west side of the city. It is the lung of Milan. One can idle the time sitting next to a lake which was in the centre of the wooded area. But being within the city the mouse of the loud city traffic does come from time to time. The best spot I liked was sitting on a semicircular bench next to the lake. It was fall season when I visited this place. The grass was green and tree leaves were beautiful colours of yellow, orange , red and brown of different shades. There is a picnic spot and old sheds for barbecue. Good place for spending time with friends and family.\n\n\u3010130\u2020Sanz Barny \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nIts a big park where you can grill on summer days.

Time for grilling morning up to afternoon towards 8/9 am up to 4/5 pm I don\u2019t remember exactly . We\u2019ve had a great birthday celebration here. It was pity cause this place must be cure for everything we do but some people leave their trash everywhere. I hope the the government can do something on it.

It is really very large and is suitable for picnics lying on the grass, eating something on the benches or letting your children play in the area dedicated to them. The area in which it is located is really very beautiful and offers many possibilities (caf\u00e9s, restaurants, shops etc)\n\n\u3010138\u2020Andrea Nori \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nA little piece of green in the center of the technological part of Milan.

This park has everything for enjoying peaceful day outside with great views of new buildings around you and even with enough green things and benches around you. I love that contrast of mirrored buildings and nature of the park.\n\n\u3010140\u2020martinka 219 \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nLovely park of unusual design. The park is divided into sections each designed around a unique theme. One is planted with iris, another with poppies. One is a dog park another is a child&#x27;s playground. One has wooden chaise lounges instead of benches. You can walk through most segments and since the segments are odd shapes it is a very pleasant wander.\n\n\u3010141\u2020Richard Rosenbaum \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWhat a great park. Lots of space to chill, or for kids to play and you get to see lots of cool, modern buildings.

I recently visited this beautiful park and was impressed by its peaceful atmosphere and stunning scenery. The gardens are meticulously maintained, and it&#x27;s clear that the staff takes great pride in keeping the park in top shape. As I strolled through the park, I was struck by the variety of trees and plants on display, from towering palms to fragrant roses. The park also features several beautiful fountains and a lovely pond, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon stroll or picnic. What I appreciated most about Guastalla Gardens is how well-designed the park is. There are plenty of benches and seating areas scattered throughout the park, providing ample space to sit and take in the beautiful surroundings. The park is also very clean, making it a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a peaceful moment. Overall, I highly recommend a visit to Guastalla Gardens for anyone looking for a tranquil and beautiful green space in the heart of Milan. Whether you&#x27;re a local or a tourist, this park is definitely worth a visit.\n\n\u3010145\u2020Lyla \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nBeautiful park well taken care of!

It feels very relaxing even if there are many people visiting it. You can bring the kids to the playground, walk your dog, and ride your bicycle. When we visited the weather was very nice and there were many people (alone as well in group) jogging or exercising. It has also many quiet spots where you can just bring your chair and relax. From here you can also enter the Sforzesco Castle and see the Arch of Peace.\n\n\u3010109\u2020Adriana Ruini \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWe walked through Sforzesco Castle grounds and came out at this lovely lush green park area with a lovely pond full of large fish and terrapins.

It&#x27;s a happy place for me notwithstanding the name they decided to give it. For respect of the harm we did when we were colonialists and for the little girls that were hurt by hard men with no scruples I wish they would change the name but.. this is the world we live in.

It is located towards the west side of the city. It is the lung of Milan. One can idle the time sitting next to a lake which was in the centre of the wooded area. But being within the city the mouse of the loud city traffic does come from time to time. The best spot I liked was sitting on a semicircular bench next to the lake. It was fall season when I visited this place. The grass was green and tree leaves were beautiful colours of yellow, orange , red and brown of different shades. There is a picnic spot and old sheds for barbecue.

It feels very relaxing even if there are many people visiting it. You can bring the kids to the playground, walk your dog, and ride your bicycle. When we visited the weather was very nice and there were many people (alone as well in group) jogging or exercising. It has also many quiet spots where you can just bring your chair and relax. From here you can also enter the Sforzesco Castle and see the Arch of Peace.\n\n\u3010109\u2020Adriana Ruini \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWe walked through Sforzesco Castle grounds and came out at this lovely lush green park area with a lovely pond full of large fish and terrapins.

It&#x27;s not huge but for Milan it is. It has rolling fields, gorgeous ancient trees, dog parks, a museum, a brook and children playing. It&#x27;s a happy place for me notwithstanding the name they decided to give it. For respect of the harm we did when we were colonialists and for the little girls that were hurt by hard men with no scruples I wish they would change the name but.. this is the world we live in. Beautiful gardens though.\n\n\u3010114\u2020Bianca MM \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nI was very positively surprised to have found this place right in the center of Milan.

It is located towards the west side of the city. It is the lung of Milan. One can idle the time sitting next to a lake which was in the centre of the wooded area. But being within the city the mouse of the loud city traffic does come from time to time. The best spot I liked was sitting on a semicircular bench next to the lake. It was fall season when I visited this place. The grass was green and tree leaves were beautiful colours of yellow, orange , red and brown of different shades. There is a picnic spot and old sheds for barbecue. Good place for spending time with friends and family.\n\n\u3010130\u2020Sanz Barny \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nIts a big park where you can grill on summer days.

Time for grilling morning up to afternoon towards 8/9 am up to 4/5 pm I don\u2019t remember exactly . We\u2019ve had a great birthday celebration here. It was pity cause this place must be cure for everything we do but some people leave their trash everywhere. I hope the the government can do something on it.

It is really very large and is suitable for picnics lying on the grass, eating something on the benches or letting your children play in the area dedicated to them.

The park is divided into sections each designed around a unique theme. One is planted with iris, another with poppies. One is a dog park another is a child&#x27;s playground. One has wooden chaise lounges instead of benches. You can walk through most segments and since the segments are odd shapes it is a very pleasant wander.\n\n\u3010141\u2020Richard Rosenbaum \u2014 Google review\u2020www.google.com\u3011\n\nWhat a great park. Lots of space to chill, or for kids to play and you get to see lots of cool, modern buildings.

I recently visited this beautiful park and was impressed by its peaceful atmosphere and stunning scenery. The gardens are meticulously maintained, and it&#x27;s clear that the staff takes great pride in keeping the park in top shape.

The park also features several beautiful fountains and a lovely pond, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon stroll or picnic. What I appreciated most about Guastalla Gardens is how well-designed the park is. There are plenty of benches and seating areas scattered throughout the park, providing ample space to sit and take in the beautiful surroundings. The park is also very clean, making it a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a peaceful moment.

Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Increase `pred_iou_thresh`**: Raising the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold will result in fewer, more distinct masks being generated. This means the algorithm will be more conservative in creating separate masks, which could help in grouping the cat and the dog into distinct segments.\n\n2. **Adjust `stability_score_thresh`**: A higher stability score threshold might reduce the number of masks by filtering out those that are less stable. This can help in avoiding over-segmentation.\n\n3. **Modify `box_nms_thresh`**: Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is used to filter out overlapping masks. By increasing the `box_nms_thresh`, you can allow more overlap, which might result in larger, more encompassing masks.\n\n4. **Decrease `points_per_side` or modify `point_grids`**: Reducing the number of points used for sampling or changing their distribution can affect the granularity of the segmentation. Fewer points might lead to less detailed masks, which is what you&#x27;re aiming for in this case.\n\n5. **Increase `min_mask_region_area`**: Setting a higher minimum area for mask regions can help in filtering out smaller segmented areas, potentially leading to larger, more generalized masks.\n\n6. **Experiment with `crop_n_layers` and related parameters**: If you&#x27;re using image cropping for mask prediction, adjusting the number of layers and their overlap might influence the segmentation outcome. However, this needs to be done cautiously, as it could also lead to more fragmented masks.\n\nRemember, these adjustments often require a bit of experimentation, as the optimal settings can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the images you&#x27;re working with. Start by adjusting one parameter at a time and observe the effects on the segmentation results.

Further parameter tuning or post-processing might be necessary to refine the masks to your satisfaction.\n\nFor even more precise segmentation, consider these additional adjustments:\n\n- **Post-processing**: After segmentation, you can apply morphological operations like dilation and erosion to smooth the edges of the masks.\n- **Manual editing**: In cases where automatic segmentation is not perfect, manual touch-ups using image editing software could be the final step to achieve the desired result.\n- **Deep learning-based refinement**: Use another model or fine-tune the existing model with more specific data similar to the images you&#x27;re processing to improve the segmentation results.\n\nRemember that segmentation can sometimes be as much an art as a science, requiring a balance between automated processes and manual adjustments."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa22d97-1fd5-48e8-8061-6a20c0af85df", "is_complete": true, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa22d97-1fd5-48e8-8061-6a20c0af85df", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "8436423a-07e8-4861-91d1-3f6174551384", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "255f004d-9413-4265-8d7d-6504fe66c148", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "id": "255f004d-9413-4265-8d7d-6504fe66c148"}, {"title": "Identify Available Classes", "create_time": 1702244722.234427, "update_time": 1702244735.296862, "mapping": {"270be962-ec42-4ad4-82bb-cc7ae00d6f15": {"id": "270be962-ec42-4ad4-82bb-cc7ae00d6f15", "message": {"id": "270be962-ec42-4ad4-82bb-cc7ae00d6f15", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa10727-7ccd-482d-9392-06baf2a32c74", "children": ["aaa2fa79-b051-4197-bfd6-7837ccd6a059"]}, "aaa10727-7ccd-482d-9392-06baf2a32c74": {"id": "aaa10727-7ccd-482d-9392-06baf2a32c74", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["270be962-ec42-4ad4-82bb-cc7ae00d6f15"]}, "aaa2fa79-b051-4197-bfd6-7837ccd6a059": {"id": "aaa2fa79-b051-4197-bfd6-7837ccd6a059", "message": {"id": "aaa2fa79-b051-4197-bfd6-7837ccd6a059", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1702244722.235349, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Khq8rr5WiYEcQJSamNZVd6tp", "size_bytes": 766353, "width": 554, "height": 565, "fovea": null, "metadata": null}, "consider you are a geospatial data analyst looking to segment the following satellite image, you need to find out which classes are present in the image of the following classes: [vegetation, built-up, bare-lane, roads, water], reply with a list of the available classes only."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"name": "RGB_output.png", "id": "file-Khq8rr5WiYEcQJSamNZVd6tp", "size": 766353, "mimeType": "image/png", "width": 554, "height": 565}], "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "270be962-ec42-4ad4-82bb-cc7ae00d6f15", "children": ["0ea263b9-9d37-47d5-a1a4-b0331e2c9a63"]}, "0ea263b9-9d37-47d5-a1a4-b0331e2c9a63": {"id": "0ea263b9-9d37-47d5-a1a4-b0331e2c9a63", "message": {"id": "0ea263b9-9d37-47d5-a1a4-b0331e2c9a63", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1702244734.344263, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the satellite image provided, here is a list of the classes that appear to be present:\n\n1.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of how `rasterio` is used in the provided code:\n\n1. **Opening TIFF Files**: The function `read_band` uses `rasterio.open` to open a TIFF file. This is done within a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure the file is properly closed after reading. The file path is passed as an argument to `rasterio.open`.\n\n   ```python\n   def read_band(file_path):\n       with rasterio.open(file_path) as src:\n           return src.read(1)\n   ```\n\n   In this function, `src.read(1)` reads the first band of the raster data from the file. The number `1` here denotes the first band since raster images can have multiple bands (layers of data).\n\n2. **Writing TIFF Files**: The `write_band` function is used to write data to a TIFF file. It also uses `rasterio.open`, but with `&#x27;w&#x27;` mode specified for writing. The function takes the output path, data to write, and a profile (which contains metadata such as the data format, dimensions, etc.).\n\n   ```python\n   def write_band(output_path, data, profile):\n       with rasterio.open(output_path, &#x27;w&#x27;, **profile) as dst:\n           dst.write(data, 1)\n   ```\n\n   Here, `dst.write(data, 1)` writes the provided data to the first band of the output file.\n\n3. **Managing Raster Profiles**: When reading the first band file, the code stores its profile (metadata information) using `src.profile`. This profile is then used later to write the output files, ensuring they have the same metadata as the input files.\n\n   ```python\n   if profile is None:\n       with rasterio.open(file_path) as src:\n           profile = src.profile\n   ```\n\n4. **Processing Multiple Bands**: The code is designed to process multiple bands from Landsat 9 imagery, such as Coastal Aerosol, Blue, Green, Red, NIR (Near Infrared), SWIR1, and SWIR2 bands. Each band is read individually using `read_band`, and the data is stored in a dictionary (`bands`).\n\n5. **Calculating Indices**: Various vegetation and surface indices like NDVI, NDWI, EVI, SAVI, NDTI, NDBI, NDBaI, and NDSI are calculated using the bands. These indices are typically used in remote sensing to analyze different aspects of the Earth&#x27;s surface, like vegetation health, water content, urban areas, etc.\n\n6. **Saving Results**: The calculated indices are then written as separate TIFF files using the `write_band` function.\n\nIn summary, `rasterio` is crucial in this code for opening and reading data from TIFF files, manipulating this data to calculate various indices, and then writing these indices back to new TIFF files."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2717e-7160-4be6-aeca-19662a056789", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2717e-7160-4be6-aeca-19662a056789", "children": ["aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c"]}, "aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c": {"id": "aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c", "message": {"id": "aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699666744.254377, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["but the outputs have a size of 1-2 MB where the inputs are of 100MB of size, what is the cause?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "15ad4481-5474-40f1-84c2-962dd31e01b5", "children": ["bea5026b-2307-4f15-960e-4070182c297e"]}, "bea5026b-2307-4f15-960e-4070182c297e": {"id": "bea5026b-2307-4f15-960e-4070182c297e", "message": {"id": "bea5026b-2307-4f15-960e-4070182c297e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699666766.61836, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The significant difference in file size between the input TIFF files (around 100MB) and the output files (1-2 MB) in your processing workflow can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Data Type and Precision**: The input TIFF files from Landsat 9 likely contain high-precision data types, such as 16-bit integers or 32-bit floats, which take up more space. The output files might be using a lower precision data type. For instance, if your calculations result in a floating-point number but you save it as an 8-bit integer, this could significantly reduce the file size.\n\n2. **Compression**: The output TIFF files may be using a compression algorithm. Rasterio supports various compression methods, and if the output files are being compressed more effectively than the input files, this would result in smaller file sizes. Check the `profile` used in `write_band` to see if there&#x27;s any compression setting.\n\n3. **Spatial Resolution**: If the output files have a lower spatial resolution than the input files, they would naturally be smaller in size. This could happen if there&#x27;s any resampling or aggregation of the input data during processing.\n\n4. **Number of Bands**: The input files may contain multiple bands (multispectral data), while the output files might only contain a single band (like NDVI, NDWI, etc.). Fewer bands result in smaller file sizes.\n\n5. **Bit Depth Reduction**: The process of calculating indices like NDVI, NDWI, etc., often results in data that does not require the full bit depth of the original images. For example, if the original images are 16-bit, but the calculated indices are scaled and stored as 8-bit, this would significantly reduce the file size.\n\n6. **Data Sparsity**: The processed data might be more sparse than the original data (containing more zero or no-data values), which can be more efficiently compressed.\n\n7. **Subsetting or Cropping**: If the processing includes subsetting or cropping the original data to a smaller region, the output files would be smaller.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, you would need to examine the specific details of the input files (such as bit depth, compression, number of bands, and spatial resolution) and compare them to how the output files are being saved in terms of data type, compression, and other factors. You can check these details using Rasterio by inspecting the `profile` or metadata of both input and output files."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa26128-3e87-430e-b6ef-8aad5d46728c", "children": ["aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e"]}, "aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e": {"id": "aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e", "message": {"id": "aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699666859.567277, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["these are the inputs and outputs, tell me what&#x27;s the difference\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"name": "NDWI.tif", "id": "file-Yd6QjHkZrZa8HoVKhl3gJtyF", "size": 2128354, "mimeType": "image/tiff"}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_174038_20230622_20230624_02_T1_SR_B6.TIF", "id": "file-FdMBB28zgmSNAHAbYElsj6wb", "size": 94887617, "mimeType": "image/tiff"}], "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "bea5026b-2307-4f15-960e-4070182c297e", "children": ["d8ac6edb-3e1f-4d5f-95e2-da9e35e8edf5"]}, "d8ac6edb-3e1f-4d5f-95e2-da9e35e8edf5": {"id": "d8ac6edb-3e1f-4d5f-95e2-da9e35e8edf5", "message": {"id": "d8ac6edb-3e1f-4d5f-95e2-da9e35e8edf5", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699666933.739621, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "from osgeo import gdal\n\n# Define the file paths for the input and output files\ninput_file = &#x27;/mnt/data/LC09_L2SP_174038_20230622_20230624_02_T1_SR_B6.TIF&#x27;\noutput_file = &#x27;/mnt/data/NDWI.tif&#x27;\n\n# Function to get metadata of a TIFF file\ndef get_tiff_metadata(file_path):\n    dataset = gdal.Open(file_path)\n    metadata = {\n        &quot;Driver&quot;: dataset.GetDriver().ShortName,\n        &quot;Size&quot;: (dataset.RasterXSize, dataset.RasterYSize),\n        &quot;Bands&quot;: dataset.RasterCount,\n        &quot;DataType&quot;: gdal.GetDataTypeName(dataset.GetRasterBand(1).DataType),\n        &quot;Compression&quot;: dataset.GetMetadataItem(&quot;COMPRESSION&quot;, &quot;IMAGE_STRUCTURE&quot;)\n    }\n    dataset = None\n    return metadata\n\n# Get metadata for both files\ninput_metadata = get_tiff_metadata(input_file)\noutput_metadata = get_tiff_metadata(output_file)\n\ninput_metadata, output_metadata\n"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100265]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "python"}, "parent": "aaa2e5ce-e483-4631-b57f-291fc761949e", "children": ["01f4872e-2f4b-4c82-9191-5f4430fd8f34"]}, "01f4872e-2f4b-4c82-9191-5f4430fd8f34": {"id": "01f4872e-2f4b-4c82-9191-5f4430fd8f34", "message": {"id": "01f4872e-2f4b-4c82-9191-5f4430fd8f34", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "python", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699666933.741934, "update_time": 1699666879.4420629, "content": {"content_type": "execution_output", "text": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[1], line 1\n----&gt;

If the output file has more homogeneous or sparse data, it could be compressed more efficiently even with the same compression method.\n\n2. **Overviews or Pyramids**: If the input file contains overviews (reduced-resolution copies of the image for faster access at lower zoom levels), and the output file does not, this could explain the size difference.\n\n3. **Internal Tiling**: Differences in how the data is tiled within the file can impact compression efficiency.\n\n4. **No-data Values**: A significant number of no-data values in the output file could also lead to more efficient compression.\n\nTo further investigate, you might want to examine the actual data distribution within the files or check for the presence of overviews or internal tiling structures."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "824213bd-5a73-48d3-84b6-2d12c2f4d272", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "824213bd-5a73-48d3-84b6-2d12c2f4d272", "children": ["aaa2c498-f145-40b9-9b9c-1738f385462c"]}, "aaa2c498-f145-40b9-9b9c-1738f385462c": {"id": "aaa2c498-f145-40b9-9b9c-1738f385462c", "message": {"id": "aaa2c498-f145-40b9-9b9c-1738f385462c", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699667665.295111, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["ok its a landsat 9 image, what bands do you need to mcalculate the ndwi?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "665e0ca2-c531-446c-b1a2-191ddfe2f479", "children": ["9f46a07e-0610-4160-9cb1-425eb08a5617"]}, "9f46a07e-0610-4160-9cb1-425eb08a5617": {"id": "9f46a07e-0610-4160-9cb1-425eb08a5617", "message": {"id": "9f46a07e-0610-4160-9cb1-425eb08a5617", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1699667676.43724, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) using Landsat 9 imagery, you typically need two specific spectral bands:\n\n1. **Green Band**: This band is used to capture green light reflected from the Earth&#x27;s surface.

However, if you are not getting the expected results, there could be a few areas to check:\n\n1. **Band Data Reading**: Ensure that the bands are being read correctly. Verify that `read_band` is correctly reading the data from the TIFF files and that the band numbers correspond to the correct Landsat 9 bands. For NDWI, you need Band 3 (Green) and Band 5 (NIR). Check if the `get_band_number` function is correctly identifying these bands from the filenames.\n\n2. **Data Types and Scaling**: When you read the bands and perform calculations, you convert the band data to floats. Ensure this conversion does not inadvertently affect the data. Also, Landsat data might be scaled, so make sure if any scaling is needed, it&#x27;s applied correctly.\n\n3. **Handling of No-Data Values**: Check how no-data values are handled in your calculations. These can affect the results if not properly accounted for. You might need to set a mask or handle these values explicitly.\n\n4. **Calculation of NDWI**: Your NDWI calculation seems correct, but ensure that the input bands (Green and NIR) are not switched or mislabeled. The formula is `(Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)`.\n\n5. **File Paths and Accessibility**: Ensure that all file paths are correctly specified and that the files are accessible in the given directory. This includes both the input files and the output directory.\n\n6. **Profile Consistency**: You&#x27;re using the profile from the first file read to write the output. Ensure that this profile is appropriate for the output files as well, especially in terms of data type and compression.\n\n7. **Output Data Type**: You are writing the output as `rasterio.float32`. Make sure this is the appropriate data type for the results you expect. \n\n8. **Visual Inspection**: Sometimes, the issue might not be with the calculation but with how the results are interpreted or visualized. Compare your results visually with a known good NDWI calculation to see if there is a noticeable difference.\n\nTo debug, you might want to add print statements or logs at various stages of your code to check the intermediate values and outputs. This can help pinpoint where the discrepancy arises.

This is a common issue when working with high-resolution geospatial data, like Landsat images, as they require significant memory for processing.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we can adopt a couple of strategies:\n\n1. **Process the Data in Chunks**: Instead of reading and processing the entire dataset at once, we can read and process it in smaller chunks. This method reduces the memory footprint at any given time.\n\n2. **Reduce Data Precision**: If processing in chunks is still not feasible, another option is to reduce the precision of the data. For example, converting the data to `float32` instead of `float64` can halve the memory requirement.\n\nLet&#x27;s try the first approach by processing the data in chunks.

If agriculture is present, it might appear as patterned green patches (like rows of crops), but no such distinct patterns are clearly visible in this image.\n\nFor a more accurate and detailed Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, you might consider using higher resolution imagery, multispectral or hyperspectral data, or ground truthing to verify specific land cover types."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa254cf-3188-42d1-9309-0f24b8a884d9", "is_complete": true, "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa254cf-3188-42d1-9309-0f24b8a884d9", "children": ["aaa220da-5fb5-450e-8cb1-5cf6ff8ea7dd"]}, "aaa220da-5fb5-450e-8cb1-5cf6ff8ea7dd": {"id": "aaa220da-5fb5-450e-8cb1-5cf6ff8ea7dd", "message": {"id": "aaa220da-5fb5-450e-8cb1-5cf6ff8ea7dd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1698757125.619066, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-mAA8u1xeBlgVQG9HP7sgK0OB", "size_bytes": 989692, "width": 2149, "height": 1480, "fovea": null, "metadata": null}, "With reference to the previous image, this image has some boxes of ddifferenct colors on top of it, where each box is on top of a specific class, some boxes may be missplaced, but in general, which color represents whch class?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "e096986b-0dd3-4076-8fcc-b41ff6007d99", "children": ["286fc5cc-9946-4b20-ae7a-1925a273cc58"]}, "286fc5cc-9946-4b20-ae7a-1925a273cc58": {"id": "286fc5cc-9946-4b20-ae7a-1925a273cc58", "message": {"id": "286fc5cc-9946-4b20-ae7a-1925a273cc58", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1698757167.774939, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Using the colored boxes as reference points for the classes you mentioned in your previous query, here&#x27;s a potential interpretation:\n\n1. **Water-body (Dark Blue areas)**: The **blue boxes** seem to be placed over water bodies, so they likely represent the water-body class.\n  \n2. **Mangrove**: There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a distinct representation for mangroves, but one might expect them near water bodies.

This could be an undeveloped area, a desert region, or some sort of industrial site.\n\n6. **Bridges**: There are a couple of bridges visible, especially where the major roads cross over the water.\n\nOverall, it&#x27;s a mix of urban development with green spaces, major roadways, and natural or undeveloped land.

Your goal is to identify the clusters of pixels that have a significantly different size (either much larger or much smaller) than the average cluster size.

The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Data points with a Z-score above a certain threshold (e.g., 2 or 3) can be considered outliers.\n\nThe process would be as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the mean (\\( \\mu \\)) and standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)) of the cluster sizes.\n2. For each cluster size \\( x \\), compute its Z-score: \n\\[\nZ = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n3.

Here&#x27;s a structured summary of the method we employed:\n\n---\n\n### **Statistical Analysis of Landslide Detection using Cluster Sizes**\n\n**Objective:** Identify significant clusters (possible landslide regions) in a differenced satellite image by analyzing the sizes of pixel clusters.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Segmentation**\n   - Convert the differenced image to grayscale.\n   - Threshold the image to create a binary mask, highlighting the regions of change.\n   - Label each connected component (cluster) in the binary image.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**\n   - For each cluster, calculate its size in terms of the number of pixels.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**\n   - Use the Z-score method to identify outlier clusters based on size.\n\n**Z-score Calculation:**\nGiven a set of data, the Z-score for an individual data point \\( x \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n   - \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the data.\n   - \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the data.\n\nClusters with a Z-score magnitude greater than a predefined threshold (in our case, 2) are considered outliers. The larger the magnitude of the Z-score, the further away the data point is from the mean, and hence the more it is considered an outlier.\n\n**Results:**\n- Total clusters identified: 34 (including the background)\n- Background cluster size: 33,564 pixels (subsequently ignored in the analysis)\n- Largest non-background cluster (identified as an outlier): 1,687 pixels\n\n---\n\nYou can use this structured summary as documentation or reference.

However, I can provide information on some significant landslides that occurred up until that time. If there have been major landslides after 2022, I recommend checking trusted news sources or relevant geological agencies for the most recent information.\n\nUp to 2022, here are some notable landslides:\n\n1. **Oso, Washington, USA (2014)**: In March 2014, a large and rapid landslide occurred near Oso, Washington, resulting in the deaths of 43 people. The landslide covered an area of about 1 square mile and destroyed many homes.\n\n2. **Sunkoshi Blockade, Nepal (2014)**: A landslide in the Sunkoshi River in August 2014 blocked the river and created a temporary dam. The subsequent release of the impounded water caused downstream flooding.\n\n3. **Sierra Leone (2017)**: A devastating landslide struck the outskirts of the capital, Freetown, in August 2017. Heavy rainfall triggered the landslide, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people and left many more homeless.\n\n4. **Guatemalan Landslides (2015 &amp; 2020)**: In 2015, a large landslide in the town of El Cambray II, near Guatemala City, killed at least 280 people. In 2020, Hurricane Eta caused several landslides in Guatemala, leading to significant casualties and damage.\n\n5. **Kerala, India (2018 &amp; 2019)**: The state of Kerala in India experienced multiple landslides in 2018 and 2019 due to heavy monsoon rains. These landslides caused considerable loss of life and damage to property.\n\n6. **Norway (2020)**: A quick clay landslide in Alta, Norway, in June 2020 resulted in the destruction of several houses. Fortunately, there were no fatalities as residents had been evacuated.\n\n7. **Japan (2021)**: In July 2021, the city of Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture experienced a massive landslide after heavy rainfall. Multiple people were reported missing, and many homes were destroyed.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there have been many other landslides worldwide with varying degrees of impact.

Adjust the LAT and LON variables as needed for different locations.\n- The script fetches RGB images using bands B04 (Red), B03 (Green), and B02 (Blue) from the Sentinel-2 L2A data type. Adjust the bands and evalscript as needed for different visualizations or data types.\n\nRemember, the above script is a general guide.

This suggests that the response from the USGS Earth Explorer API didn&#x27;t contain valid JSON data, and the `requests` library failed to decode it. \n\nHere are a few possible reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **The endpoint didn&#x27;t return JSON**: It&#x27;s possible that the endpoint didn&#x27;t return a JSON response. You might have received an HTML response (e.g., a login page or an error page) or plain text.\n\n2. **HTTP Errors**: The request might have failed for some reason, and the server returned an error page instead of the expected JSON response.\n\n3. **Endpoint Changes**: The API endpoints or their expected payloads might have changed since my last update. It&#x27;s always a good idea to refer to the official API documentation for any updates or changes.\n\nHere&#x27;s what you can do to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n- **Check the HTTP status code**: Before attempting to parse the JSON, check the HTTP status code of the response to ensure the request was successful.\n  \n  ```python\n  response = requests.get(URL, params=payload)\n  if response.status_code != 200:\n      print(&quot;Error:&quot;, response.status_code, response.text)\n  else:\n      data = response.json()\n  ```\n\n- **Print the response**: Before decoding it as JSON, print the raw response content to see what you&#x27;re getting. This can give you clues about what&#x27;s going wrong.\n\n  ```python\n  print(response.text)\n  ```\n\n- **Check API documentation**: Ensure that you&#x27;re using the correct endpoints, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and payload structure.

Here are some common methods and techniques used:\n\n1. **Pre- and Post-event Image Comparison**: \n   - This is the most straightforward method where you visually or algorithmically compare images from before and after the event. \n   - Any significant color or texture changes can indicate ground movement.\n\n2. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Analysis**:\n   - NDVI is used to monitor vegetation health.\n   - A significant drop in NDVI values in a post-event image compared to a pre-event image can indicate vegetation loss due to a landslide.\n\n3. **Change Detection Algorithms**:\n   - Techniques such as image differencing, image ratioing, and principal component analysis can be used to highlight the differences between pre-event and post-event images.\n   - For example, in image differencing, the post-event image is subtracted from the pre-event image, highlighting the areas of change.\n\n4. **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry**:\n   - SAR images can capture surface deformation with high precision.\n   - Interferometric SAR (InSAR) can detect ground displacements between two acquisitions, making it a valuable tool for detecting landslides and other ground movements.\n   - The output, called an interferogram, can show the pattern of ground movement.\n\n5. **Texture Analysis**:\n   - Landslides can change the texture of the terrain.\n   - Texture metrics, like entropy or variance, calculated from a moving window around each pixel, can help in identifying these changes.\n\n6. **Machine Learning**:\n   - Supervised learning techniques can be trained using labeled examples of landslide areas and non-landslide areas. The trained model can then be used to identify potential landslide regions in new images.\n   - Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise in automatically detecting and segmenting landslide areas from satellite imagery.\n\n7. **Multispectral and Hyperspectral Analysis**:\n   - Different ground materials reflect light differently across various spectral bands.\n   - Analyzing the spectral signature of regions can help in distinguishing landslide areas from unaffected areas.\n\n8. **Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Analysis**:\n   - Landslides result in elevation changes.\n   - By comparing DEMs from before and after the event, areas with significant elevation changes can be identified.\n\n9. **Integration with Other Data**:\n   - Landslide detection can be improved by integrating satellite imagery with other data sources like rainfall data, soil moisture levels, and ground-based observations.\n\nIn practice, the best results often come from combining multiple methods. For instance, visual comparison might be combined with NDVI analysis and change detection algorithms to get a comprehensive understanding of the affected area."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-code-interpreter", "parent_id": "aaa2eec4-c0d6-413b-8008-b466f192f773", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2eec4-c0d6-413b-8008-b466f192f773", "children": ["aaa26ad8-30f3-4117-9a91-c28935bdeb7d"]}, "aaa26ad8-30f3-4117-9a91-c28935bdeb7d": {"id": "aaa26ad8-30f3-4117-9a91-c28935bdeb7d", "message": {"id": "aaa26ad8-30f3-4117-9a91-c28935bdeb7d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696861555.853372, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["for the images we have retrieved using ee, which of the aboice methods can we use?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "3a159794-b137-4379-af00-0c8fdf17c6a9", "children": ["a2e0f299-99ba-493d-b849-91a644a8779f"]}, "a2e0f299-99ba-493d-b849-91a644a8779f": {"id": "a2e0f299-99ba-493d-b849-91a644a8779f", "message": {"id": "a2e0f299-99ba-493d-b849-91a644a8779f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696861605.214471, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Given the images you&#x27;ve retrieved using the Earth Engine (`ee` library) from the Landsat 8 collection, here are the methods from the list that can be effectively applied:\n\n1. **Pre- and Post-event Image Comparison**:\n   - Using the images you&#x27;ve fetched, visually inspecting or algorithmically comparing pre- and post-event images can reveal the areas affected by the landslide. Any significant changes in color or texture might indicate ground movement.\n\n2. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Analysis**:\n   - The Landsat 8 collection provides the necessary bands (specifically Red and Near-Infrared) to compute NDVI. A decrease in NDVI values in post-event images compared to pre-event images could indicate vegetation loss due to the landslide.\n\n3. **Change Detection Algorithms**:\n   - You can perform image differencing by subtracting the post-event image from the pre-event image. This will highlight the areas of change, which can be indicative of landslide-affected regions.\n\n4. **Texture Analysis**:\n   - You can compute texture metrics, like entropy or variance, on the Landsat images to identify changes in terrain texture caused by the landslide.\n\n5. **Machine Learning**:\n   - If you have labeled examples of landslide areas and non-landslide areas from other datasets or through manual annotation, you can train machine learning models (like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines) using the spectral bands of Landsat as features. Once trained, these models can classify potential landslide regions in the images.\n\n6. **Multispectral Analysis**:\n   - Landsat 8 provides multiple spectral bands, which can be used to analyze the spectral signature of regions and distinguish between landslide-affected and unaffected areas.\n\nWhile methods like SAR Interferometry and DEM Analysis are powerful for landslide detection, they require specific data sources that aren&#x27;t available in the Landsat 8 collection. SAR data would come from satellites like Sentinel-1, and high-resolution DEM changes would require datasets like those from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) or LiDAR collections, both before and after the event.\n\nGiven the data you have, I recommend starting with visual comparison and NDVI analysis, followed by change detection algorithms.

Here are some commonly used techniques:\n\n1. **Image Differencing**: As demonstrated, this method involves subtracting pixel values of one image from another. It&#x27;s simple and effective for detecting gross changes.\n\n2. **Image Ratioing**: In this method, pixel values of one image are divided by the corresponding pixel values of another image. It&#x27;s particularly useful when the changes are subtle.\n\n3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA transforms the original bands of images into a new set of uncorrelated bands. The first few components usually capture the majority of the variation in the data. By comparing the principal components of two images, changes can be detected.\n\n4. **Change Vector Analysis**: This method involves calculating the magnitude and direction of change between two multi-band images. It&#x27;s useful for understanding the nature and magnitude of the changes.\n\n5. **Post-classification Comparison**: In this method, each image is classified separately into land cover categories. The resulting classified images are then compared pixel-by-pixel to detect changes.\n\n6. **Kappa Coefficient of Agreement**: Used in conjunction with post-classification comparison, the Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure of classification accuracy, highlighting areas of change and no-change.\n\n7. **Tasseled Cap Transformation**: This transformation converts multi-band satellite images into a set of new bands representing brightness, greenness, and wetness. Changes in these factors can indicate landslides, especially when vegetation is removed or soil becomes wet.\n\n8. **Multitemporal Spectral Analysis**: Analyzing the spectral signatures of a region over multiple time periods can reveal changes due to landslides.\n\n9. **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry**: As mentioned earlier, SAR images can capture surface deformation. By comparing two SAR images taken at different times, ground displacement due to a landslide can be detected.\n\n10. **Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing**: Landslides can sometimes cause changes in surface temperature. Detecting these temperature changes using thermal infrared bands can provide additional information.\n\n11. **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**: Modern techniques involve training models on labeled datasets to automatically detect and classify changes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used for change detection in remote sensing imagery.\n\nIt&#x27;s worth noting that the best approach often depends on the specific scenario, the available data, and the goals of the analysis. Often, a combination of multiple techniques provides the most comprehensive understanding of the changes."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-code-interpreter", "parent_id": "aaa25fb6-4ab0-46c9-afbf-f7472ba8541e", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa25fb6-4ab0-46c9-afbf-f7472ba8541e", "children": ["aaa22661-d336-4ced-b2c9-b3639df0309b"]}, "aaa22661-d336-4ced-b2c9-b3639df0309b": {"id": "aaa22661-d336-4ced-b2c9-b3639df0309b", "message": {"id": "aaa22661-d336-4ced-b2c9-b3639df0309b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696889444.601015, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["for the code, make it so that the clipped area is rectangular not cirular"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "7f63bcc9-9833-4906-b7b3-299bbd8dc925", "children": ["c808d8f6-f90c-4fad-9107-82f3a4415037"]}, "c808d8f6-f90c-4fad-9107-82f3a4415037": {"id": "c808d8f6-f90c-4fad-9107-82f3a4415037", "message": {"id": "c808d8f6-f90c-4fad-9107-82f3a4415037", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696889567.252012, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To clip the images to a rectangular region instead of a circular buffer, we can modify the region of interest definition in our `fetch_and_display_image` function. \n\nThe `ee.Geometry.Rectangle` method can be used to define a rectangular region in Earth Engine.

Using machine learning for change detection can be quite effective. Here&#x27;s a basic outline of how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: We need to prepare the data for training and testing. This involves:\n    - Loading the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; images.\n    - Creating labeled data, where the label indicates whether a change occurred in a particular pixel or region.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: We need to extract relevant features from the images. Raw pixel values can be used, but more sophisticated features can be derived from the spectral, spatial, and texture characteristics of the images.\n\n3. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable machine learning model. For image data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often a good choice. However, for simplicity, we can start with a basic classifier like a Random Forest or Support Vector Machine.\n\n4. **Training**: Train the model using the labeled data.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model&#x27;s performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.\n\n6. **Change Detection**: Use the trained model to predict changes in the images. This will give us a change map that highlights areas of change.\n\nFor this demonstration, I&#x27;ll use a simplified approach using the Random Forest classifier to detect changes between the two images:\n\n1. Load the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; images.\n2. Flatten the images to create a dataset where each row is a pixel and columns represent the RGB values of the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; images.\n3. Train a Random Forest classifier on a subset of the data (using manual labels or simple differencing to create labels).\n4. Predict changes on the entire dataset.\n5. Reshape the predictions to get a change map.\n\nLet&#x27;s proceed with this approach."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100265]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-code-interpreter", "parent_id": "aaa2bf42-32d8-4967-81fc-da6de28c2d77", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa2bf42-32d8-4967-81fc-da6de28c2d77", "children": ["3ebbabf1-3fd6-45ce-9f23-3bb5a06c93b1"]}, "3ebbabf1-3fd6-45ce-9f23-3bb5a06c93b1": {"id": "3ebbabf1-3fd6-45ce-9f23-3bb5a06c93b1", "message": {"id": "3ebbabf1-3fd6-45ce-9f23-3bb5a06c93b1", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696889781.235599, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "unknown", "text": "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\n\n# Load the images\nimg1_np = np.array(Image.open(&#x27;/mnt/data/download (1).png&#x27;).convert(&#x27;RGB&#x27;))\nimg2_np = np.array(Image.open(&#x27;/mnt/data/download (2).png&#x27;).convert(&#x27;RGB&#x27;))\n\n# Flatten the images\nimg1_flatten = img1_np.reshape(-1, 3)\nimg2_flatten = img2_np.reshape(-1, 3)\n\n# Create a dataset\nX = np.hstack((img1_flatten, img2_flatten))\n\n# Use simple image differencing to create labels\n# If the absolute difference in pixel values is above a threshold, label as change (1), else no change (0)\nthreshold = 30\ny = np.any(np.abs(img1_flatten - img2_flatten) &gt;

number of classes based on their natural separations in the data.\n     - Assign real-world meaning to these classes (like water, vegetation, etc.).\n   - **Supervised Classification**:\n     - **Training Data Collection**: Collect samples (regions of interest) from the image for each known class (buildings, soil, water, vegetation, etc.).\n     - **Model Training**: Use these samples to train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).\n     - **Prediction**: Apply the trained model to classify each pixel in the image.\n\n### 4. **Post-Classification**\n   - **Accuracy Assessment**: Compare the classified image to some reference data (if available) to assess the accuracy of the classification.\n   - **Smoothing/Filtering**: Apply techniques to smooth the classified image and reduce misclassified pixels/noise.\n   - **Class Refinement**: If certain classes are consistently misclassified, manual corrections or adjustments can be made.\n\n### 5. **Result Visualization and Interpretation**\n   - **Generate a Classified Map**: Visualize the final classified image using a color-coded map.\n   - **Quantitative Analysis**: Calculate the area (or percentage area) covered by each class.\n\n### 6. **Further Analysis (optional)**\n   - **Change Detection**: If you have another Landsat 8 image from a different time, you can conduct change detection to see how land use/land cover has changed over time.\n\nOnce the conceptual workflow is in place, the next step would be to implement each step using software tools, such as QGIS, ArcGIS, or Python-based tools like Rasterio and scikit-learn.\n\nNow, if you provide the data, we can start with the actual analysis!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-code-interpreter", "parent_id": "aaa23bc3-87de-4ceb-9d00-6a42305d49bb", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "aaa23bc3-87de-4ceb-9d00-6a42305d49bb", "children": ["aaa2e6f3-a7e7-4853-a7f9-959fe9c56bef"]}, "aaa2e6f3-a7e7-4853-a7f9-959fe9c56bef": {"id": "aaa2e6f3-a7e7-4853-a7f9-959fe9c56bef", "message": {"id": "aaa2e6f3-a7e7-4853-a7f9-959fe9c56bef", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696464948.815362, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Before continuing with the analysis, I am only interested in a certain region which has the extent of 10.4635032126072485,45.4282622161035405 : 10.9692495178414191,45.9321245833442475 defined in EPSG:4326 - WGS 84, the images must be cropped to a bounding box enclosing this extent, it must be a rectangular bounding box."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B7.TIF", "id": "file-hw3u20MeJozFd0zbZmGghyY1", "size": 96058941}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B6.TIF", "id": "file-eOlxaptprjmBztXJgq8eE3eG", "size": 98769875}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B5.TIF", "id": "file-AK17afoUFMnMzM36ClrAyVqu", "size": 100255310}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B4.TIF", "id": "file-PC0jnmfhrI50GUoqbDBqfjwL", "size": 91930465}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B3.TIF", "id": "file-LCsM9L3FWciV1DD5ARNofBSL", "size": 90450646}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B2.TIF", "id": "file-vrlwogVT8xMhunhsLiLcexbp", "size": 88128606}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_SR_B1.TIF", "id": "file-rzkX4h2gJMl373UM3idurdCR", "size": 87331341}, {"name": "LC09_L2SP_193028_20231001_20231003_02_T1_MTL.txt", "id": "file-aGTwsLyjLL92FJNxQxiYNurv", "size": 15254}], "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "9f69f7de-3f27-4b13-b533-dfece929fe0e", "children": ["9fd54c24-ea90-43f8-87e5-2ee7ebbd4f7f"]}, "9fd54c24-ea90-43f8-87e5-2ee7ebbd4f7f": {"id": "9fd54c24-ea90-43f8-87e5-2ee7ebbd4f7f", "message": {"id": "9fd54c24-ea90-43f8-87e5-2ee7ebbd4f7f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1696465110.463579, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for providing the files.
